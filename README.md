We are taking data from AirBnB properties around Austin, Texas to analyze the new market of room/house rental and how it affects the existing housing and hotel industries. This data includes the listings's cost per night, zip code, rating, availability, and more. We will use machine learning to create a value guesser when given certain parameters about the AirBnB property, as well as go through rental reviews to find word association trends based on what area of the city the property is located in.

WHAT? 
1. Machine Learning property value evaluator??
2. Word association analysis (word cloud?)
3. Chloropeth map (by value)
