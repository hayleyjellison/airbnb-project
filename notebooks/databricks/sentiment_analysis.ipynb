was super friendly and her home was impeccably clean and beyond charming. Her two little dogs were quiet friendly and the separate entrance was very nice. Have never seen such a well stocked bathroom, an keurig right in the bedroom, and excellent water pressure! A great representation and slice of Austin.\r\nWould highly recommend staying with her! </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>56898680</td><td>2015-12-19</td><td>17020551</td><td>Leslie</td><td>Denise was a very sweet, accommodating host.

Wouldn't hesitate to book with again.</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>58445874</td><td>2016-01-02</td><td>8313146</td><td>Jaime</td><td>I just loved my stay at Denise's home! And, I LOVE her decor style! Everything thing one could think of to have at a BNB was available. It was also impeccably clean with a private room and bath.  Her dogs are awesome too! I would definitely stay there again. I highly recommend her property. It is also a very short drive to Downtown. My stay there was just fantastic. </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>58584255</td><td>2016-01-03</td><td>2806995</td><td>Rachel</td><td>Denise was very welcoming and made us feel right at home. She gave us full access to the kitchen, and we really appreciated all of the things she does to go above and beyond as a host. The bathroom was fully stocked with nice shampoos/soaps/amenities, and the bedroom was very comfortable. The room has a private entrance so that we could come and go as we pleased. Her dogs were adorable. All in all we really felt at home at Denise's house and would love to return. </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>59372905</td><td>2016-01-10</td><td>48798728</td><td>Charlotte</td><td>I couldn't have asked for a warmer welcome, or for a more comfortable stay.  Denise is a very thoughtful and committed host, who will always go the extra mile for guests. Whatever the question, she will endeavour to answer it. Her care for detail is reflected in the space she has provided: spotless and stylish, with plenty of character. She also strikes me as a very versatile host. I was in Austin for a conference, and was able to concentrate well at Denise's place when (unfortunately) I needed to work. But her sense of fun will also make her an excellent guide if you are out to discover all the cool things the city has to offer!\r\n\r\nSo - if you're going to Austin, stay here!</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>60522554</td><td>2016-01-24</td><td>26792421</td><td>Rubie</td><td>Denise was SO nice and welcoming! :) She stayed in contact with us as we traveled and made it easy to check in with her and get settled. She went out of her way to make our stay there enjoyable in many little ways. She provided some essentials that other airBNB's don't like spare toothbrushes, lotion, etc. she gave a great recommendation for lunch too!  The room is very clean and comfortable and you really can have as much privacy as you want with your own separate entrance, but Denise was also super friendly and willing to help in any way. Overall we had a great trip! </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>61017340</td><td>2016-01-30</td><td>30715591</td><td>Christi</td><td>The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival.

He showed me around and the backyard was awesome - I was bummed to not be able to spend more time there and sit out in the yard. The neighborhood is quite but a short ride away from downtown. The room is perfect if you're going to be out and about exploring. \r\n\r\nThanks for everything. </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>66933457</td><td>2016-03-25</td><td>62149775</td><td>Scott</td><td>Peter made me feel more than welcome in his cute house in a very convenient side of Austin.  I loved the proximity to the coffee shop as well!  Peter treated me like a long-lost cousin in that I never felt like a stranger being tolerated in someone's home! He always answered questions rapidly and even met me at the coffee shop just to check on how things were going.  I was very comfortable and secure. The private entry to the room was great and added to the overall comfort level I felt.  I'd love to stay there again and plan to book again!  This experience with Peter really speaks well for my very first airbnb experience!  I'll be using it now for sure!</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>67669293</td><td>2016-03-30</td><td>8039739</td><td>Eli</td><td>This place is great! Totally positive experience the entire way through--the East Side is the place to be in Austin. Apartment is super nice, communication with Peter was seamless and he gave us some great recommendations. Right down the street from a fantastic cafe (Figure 8) and a few blocks away from some really cool bars. Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>68262542</td><td>2016-04-03</td><td>65106405</td><td>Charles</td><td>Peter was an excellent host, he checked in with me on the morning of my arrival so he could be sure he was home when I arrived.  When I arrived he was genuine and personable as he greeted me and showed me the features of the suite, making sure I was familiar with how the TV, A/C, etc. worked.  He stressed that for any question I had during my stay, I could just call or text him and he would be more than happy to help.  The listing was extremely accurate and, though the exact location is not given, his mention of the house's proximity to a well known coffee shop (which he listed by name-Figure 8) was very useful in getting an idea of where the place was located.  The photos are slightly dated but everything not pictured has been listed in the photo descriptions and if anything, the suite is nicer now than in the pictures.  There have been additions since the pictures were taken of: an AT&T U-Verse equipped TV facing the bed, a chair along the same wall as the one the restroom door is on, a table next to the entry door with a Keurig coffee maker & snacks, additional wall artwork and a lamp on the bedside table on the wall between the bed and the restroom.  The bathroom is stocked with high-end products and the water pressure/quantity in the shower is truly unbelievable.  The neighborhood is good.  The East side of Austin is \"coming up\", so to speak, and has progressed substantially in that regard.  There are plenty of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. within easy walking distance.  My Uber ride to meet friends at the Westin downtown (at 5th & San Jacinto) cost me $7.41 in peak traffic and we had to re-route due to street closures for an event which was not bad at all.  Overall, this place was great.  I found it better and cheaper than a hotel downtown and Peter was very accommodating, especially for a first-time user of Airbnb.    </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>68770430</td><td>2016-04-06</td><td>2866072</td><td>Buck</td><td>Peter was terrific! He was attentive, prompt, accommodating, and a very friendly presence with loads of recommendations for off the radar places in Austin, as well as all of the known points of interest in the area. The place was very clean and organized. The photos are very accurate and fairly represent the suite and house in general. The location is quite close to downtown but very quiet and seemingly remote and separated from the late night life that makes Austin so exciting. Michelle and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thank you, Peter! </td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>69265243</td><td>2016-04-10</td><td>41916555</td><td>Jingjing</td><td>Peter is super nice host. His house is located in a quite area and exactly the same as described, clean and neat. The room is private and quite with an independent entry. The mattress is large and comfortable.\r\n\r\nPeter is very considerate. He has both Apple and micro USB charger cables ready for use. \r\n\r\nHis two dogs are very cute and friendly. \r\n\r\nI do love my staying there. I enjoyed my breakfasts at the coffee shop Peter suggested. Also, I followed his advice and visited some impressive places. </td></tr><tr><td>21337077</td><td>270111089</td><td>2018-05-28</td><td>65050188</td><td>Natalie</td><td>Amazing hotel, I will be back soon.

Peter's place is awesome!!  He was on a business trip when I arrived, so a wonderful friend of his let me in introduced me to everything in the suite.  The bed is super-comfortable, the shower and bathroom are wonderful, and the extra amenities Peter provides are extensive and quite helpful.  Peter returned in the middle of my visit and was very welcoming as well, giving me a tour of the tiny house as well.  You cannot go wrong staying at Peter's---great place, great people, wonderful location.  Uber is great, as well. And Figure 8 coffee just down the street is ace!!</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>71538884</td><td>2016-04-26</td><td>7367258</td><td>Antonio</td><td>Peter is an amazing host. My partner and I felt very welcome in his home and I wouldn't change a thing about the experience. Peter's attention to detail and his determination to make sure we had an unforgettable time in the city will not go unmentioned. The neighborhood is very hip, quiet and safe. The coffee shop down the street is definitely a bonus and the staff is friendly. It was very easy to jump into the Austin vibe, thanks to Peter and the Figure 8 staff. Overall, this is a very unique listing. I highly recommend Peter's place. I know I won't hesitate to book this place again the next time I'm in Austin.</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>71914723</td><td>2016-04-29</td><td>67665869</td><td>Will</td><td>Peter was a wonderful host! Not only was the room and attached bathroom very clean, the decor made us feel very welcome to Austin! Peter was flexible with our check-in time which was perfect because we landed very late at night. He was always recommending great local spots to go eat and drink around Austin and never made us feel like we'd be out of things to do. Water bottles, coffee, and tea were always stocked in the room making the entire experience very enjoyable and comfortable. It was my girlfriend's first time in Austin so Peter was a great source of knowledge for anyone visiting for the first time.</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>72177614</td><td>2016-05-01</td><td>4643762</td><td>Alicia</td><td>Peter was a fantastic host, he was very accommodating and had all the amenities one would need. The location of Peter's home is perfect for exploring Austin, walking distance to downtown and even closer to hip East Austin bars. The suite with private entrance and bathroom is very convenient for coming and going and makes you feel like you're in a studio apartment. If you want a place to stay that is walking distance to many Austin hot spots but want to come home to a quieter neighborhood this is the location!</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>72841169</td><td>2016-05-04</td><td>4660202</td><td>Erin</td><td>Lovely room with everything you need!

Peter's place was in a great, safe location that was close to so many different areas. The private entrance was great! We could go in and out without feeling like we were disturbing anyone. The room was just what we needed: it was clean and the bathroom was equipped with everything we needed. Peter also provided snacks, plenty of water and a Keurig in the room. \n\nWe met Peter on the night we arrived and he was such a nice, genuine person!

The weather was perfect for our stay, and the views are amazing from the top deck. I keep laughing when I think about my guests who were feeling as they were done with a marathon after taking belongings, groceries up the stairs from the bottom of the house. So just know! There are lots of stairs, even in the home, with some being very steep. Use extra caution especially with kids and elderly. Once inside, very cozy. I didn't want to leave. The parking situation is addressed in reviews already and by the host - it's very steep, nothing else to it. We had 2x cars parked in drive way that stayed there the whole time. Everyone else, coming and going, stayed at the bottom level. I'd recommend this. Please heed these warnings and words of advice especially at night. It can be tricky pulling in immediately off the main road! Would certainly be interested in having this beautiful home again!</td></tr><tr><td>7330232</td><td>434175583</td><td>2019-04-07</td><td>10678266</td><td>Michael</td><td>The guide book is very helpful</td></tr><tr><td>7330232</td><td>438412563</td><td>2019-04-16</td><td>66970557</td><td>Farasat</td><td>Great</td></tr><tr><td>7330232</td><td>442082698</td><td>2019-04-22</td><td>86361530</td><td>Becca</td><td>This lakehouse was a fantastic place for a small group (there were 7 of us). It's right on the lake (though you have to descend about 60 stairs -- no big deal!) and has amazing views of the sunset. The two porches are great for meals or just relaxing. All the beds were super comfortable. The location was great, too -- it was right on the lake but also a quick drive to marinas, the Oasis and some other nightlife and food spots.

Only issue was we went in July and when the sun started going down in the evening it got extremely hot on the main floor of the house. Curtains on the windows there would probably help.

Biking in the area is great too; it's about a 15-minute bike ride to/from Downtown. Paddy was kind enough to drive me to a bike rental shop.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is a bit eclectic with a mixture of Austin locals, artists and activists. I was fortunate to be there the same weekend as East Austin Studio Tours (EAST), which gave me a chance to explore that section of Austin. Paddy & I went to an outdoor performance that was a few blocks from her home, which was fantastic.\r\n\r\nPS: Diego is a cutie.</td></tr><tr><td>5245</td><td>10893465</td><td>2014-03-11</td><td>1256319</td><td>Robbie</td><td>Paddy couldn't have been a more accommodating host.

It's private. But if you don't have a car you'll spend a lot getting to it, it's far from the center of town. Also, while it has a toaster oven, microwave, coffee maker, and more, there are no cups, cutlery, or dishes in the room.

I would recommend this place to anyone! It was great location, close to downtown. Be advised that getting a cab to pick you up at night is very hard! If you are planning on drinking take your car, leave it and have a cab drive you home. We would then take another car to pick up in the morning on the way to the track. Just a suggestion, as its not advisable to drink and drive!

It was clean and she clearly went all out in trying to make the place comfortable. However, her level of involvement at the place was less than ideal.\r\n\r\nBesides a few hour long visits to the house, our party received no less than 21 text messages from Paddy during the stay.  She left her dog at the place (which she didn't tell us she was doing), and also texted that she would be coming by in the morning to do laundry, but would try not to disturb if we were asleep. Two early AM doorbell rings later and a woken up boss, does not a happy stay make.  My boss was very displeased with me for booking us into this place. She said \"Never Again\".\r\n\r\nGreat place, intrusive owner.</td></tr><tr><td>2265</td><td>11005865</td><td>2014-03-17</td><td>11604963</td><td>Safia</td><td>I stayed at Zen-East during SXSW.

Paddy was extremely helpful and always responded back to me very quickly.  She kindly provided us with breakfast items and suggestions on local/hill country a.  She always gave me some notice if she was coming by and I felt very comfortable staying at her property.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone.  I feel Paddy genuinely wanted to make us feel comfortable.  Considering the house is so central, I thought her rental price was very reasonable.  In all, my friends and I had a wonderful time at Zen-East and look forward to returning!</td></tr><tr><td>2265</td><td>33015130</td><td>2015-05-24</td><td>25409641</td><td>Jenna</td><td>Paddy was extremely responsive and accommodating.

When I did check-in, I knocked and messaged my host that I arrived. Yet, I waited over 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I did NOT receive any prior instructions before. I was lucky enough to check an area that had the key to get in. His excuse, he forgot. As soon as I entered the door, I get this foul odor and don't know where it is coming from. I then check the beds and they look unmade, which don't know even if they are clean or not (I asked about it, which my host said that they were). I go into the restroom it is untidy overall along with crap stains in toilet. I go into the kitchen to try to figure out where that smell is coming from. The kitchen is also unkempt, which food stains and food pieces all over the oven and microwave counter. So I call my host to tell him about the smell. He apologized and claimed the guy who manages he place would come after work (did not give me an exact time) to clean up. And he himself could not come since he was out of town. So he told me to go ahead and throw away food in the frig if I wanted to or take out the trash already there. So I did throw some items out and took out the trash in common area and in one of the bedrooms...But if your guest feels more like the cleaning lady than your guest, then you are WRONG. I could not stand the smell so I had to leave and buy SOMETHING to get that odor out, which I had to bomb the place with eliminating-odor products to get the smell at tolerable levels. I spent at least $20 on cleaning supplies (was not compensated for it even after my stay). My host's management (one guy that does the 'tidy' up) never came to check up on me that night or the next day day to follow-up. Although my host did inform me since I did not have my light on, his management assumed I was sleeping that night. Yet I would have appreciated the next day follow-up. Again, that did NOT happen. I will say this host was nice, amiable, communicative (not at first), and respectful when I talked to him over the phone. He felted bad about my experience and was constantly apologizing for it. He gave me a 1/3 reduced price off after (still not enough) & even offered the next night free (which I had already booked another reservation already). I just wished he would have taken more initiative to correct my issues immediately or prior to my arrival. So the take away from my bad experience? If you want a taste of that college experience, this is it! Otherwise, there are better and cheaper places than this...</td></tr><tr><td>21342999</td><td>223785406</td><td>2018-01-01</td><td>114314097</td><td>Elizabeth</td><td>Abdullah's place was in a great location.

Check in and check out was easy, and the host was great at keeping in touch. If you're coming in at night, you might ask for some directions to help you find the right condo since there are four separate staircases for the building and you can only access the condo from two of them.

My best friend and I took a girls trip to Austin to see all the sights and fortunately this home is conveniently located (walkable, 5-10 minutes) near the trendy SOCO neighborhood. We paid on average $7-$9 for Uber's to get basically anywhere downtown, which almost all destinations were within 10 minutes by car from their home. During the day, it was plenty easy to find an electric scooter to get around town on a budget. The home itself was immaculate, down to every last thoughtful detail- fully stocked mini fridge, extra blankets, television w/ (Hidden by Airbnb) Fiber, light snacks, and so much more. Shannon and David have thought of every last thing one could possibly need.

I loved the TX touches and Best of Austin guides. So helpful when planning where to get breakfast tacos & head to Barton Springs. We had a relaxing and fun weekend. Couldn't recommend more!

Bus line is steps away.  Uber/Lyft rides are $7-$9 to/from there and about $20 to/from the airport.  Uber is easier to get than Lyft during peak times.  Every driver and friend who came by commented how cool the house looks.  Neighborhood appears to be at the start of a revitalization where one or two homes on the block are renovated and the others not, but it feels safe.  I walked it every morning to exercise and explore.  There's also a big park about two blocks south, right along the river.\r\n\r\nSpace looks just like the photos.  Clean and bright.  Private.  Surprisingly comfortable bed... just be nimble enough to navigate up and down the ladder.\r\n\r\nWish there were a closet and/or drawers.  A mini refrigerator and a microwave would've been nice, too.  I stayed for four nights and those things would've been convenient.\r\n\r\nThe only glitch was during my arrival.  I'd contacted them about a week in advance to discuss procedures and at that time disclosed my arrival plans around 1 p.m.  Check in/out was listed as \"flexible,\" and they said that was fine, but when I touched down at the airport, I got a text apologizing, saying check-in isn't normally until 4 and could I come at 3 because the other tenant hadn't checked out yet.  I wasn't planning on wandering Austin with a suitcase for two hours, and I really just needed to drop my things off (and charge my phone) before going downtown.  I arrived just before the previous tenants and they were apologetic, saying they left to go for coffee and decided to do some sight-seeing before checking out and the time got away from them.  I think it was more awkward for them than for me.  It would've been a big deal if I were exhausted and needed a shower or to sleep, but I literally dropped off my bag, charged my phone and went straight back out until later that evening.  \r\n\r\nI had a great stay.  Roman and Andrea were super nice and accessible if I needed anything.</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>22288978</td><td>2014-11-03</td><td>2012426</td><td>Orlaith</td><td>We had such a great stay at Roman and Andrea's Private Studio.

I was just in Austin for a short stay and had to work most of the time so I didn't get to take full advantage of Roman and Andrea's hospitality but my few interactions with them were great.  They even provided an umbrella for me which was clutch since it rained most of the time I was there. The unit was incredibly clean and roomier than most hotels. Location is sweet. I'd come back!</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>23162418</td><td>2014-11-24</td><td>22737921</td><td>Nichole</td><td>Roman and Andrea were great! They were there when we arrived to welcome us and give us the quick tour. The place is adorable and is semi connected to the larger part of the home where they live. The neighborhood is a great area. Easily acessable to all areas of Austin. Would highly recommend! </td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>23667986</td><td>2014-12-07</td><td>17713635</td><td>Kaitlyn</td><td>This was our second stay at Roman & Andrea's Crash Pad.

Roman brought us coffee in the morning which was a nice touch. It's about 15 min from the airport and pretty close to a bunch of cool stuff which was nice.</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>24106508</td><td>2014-12-20</td><td>8960584</td><td>Jackye</td><td>Roman called us before we approached town then met us when we got to his property.\r\nThe description of the studio was very accurate and the picture was exactly what it looks like in real life. The quality of the furnishings is modern and of good quality. The neighborhood is an up and coming section of Austin with a mix of old and new homes.</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>24363984</td><td>2014-12-27</td><td>9710549</td><td>N'Gai</td><td>Excellent little place. Clean, private, and nicely furnished. Had pretty much what we needed except a small fridge to keep yogourt for breakfast or a beer or two. That said, I would  not hesitate to recommend staying at this place. Well located for walking and access to some really funky and delicious restaurants and pubs. Make sure to ask Roman and Andrea for advice as they won't steer you wrong. I highly suggest this place and would stay there again in a heartbeat.</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>24641654</td><td>2015-01-01</td><td>3442449</td><td>Anne</td><td>Roman and Andrea were perfect hosts and particularly helpful as we were planning our trip.

The bathroom was stocked with organic products. Walking distance from the brilliant Rainey St, convenience store and the hike-and-bike trail. A car is recommended for getting around Austin, just make sure you're familiar with the one-way streets in Downtown.\r\nWe had an awesome time with Roman and Andrea and shared travel stories and experiences who were very welcoming and happy to suggest things to do (and BBQ to eat!). The neighbourhood is a 5 minute drive to Downtown and is very quiet. If you're coming to Austin, stay with these two!</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>25858942</td><td>2015-01-27</td><td>4577802</td><td>Kath</td><td>Andrea and Roman were the sweetest hosts! Nothing was too much trouble. We arrived late on a Friday night and there was a couple of local beers waiting for us. Welcome after our travels. The tiny house is exactly as it is in the photos. The bathroom exceptional. Location is an easy walk up to East Austin. We loved our stay at Andrea and Roman's and would definitely stay again! </td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>26325612</td><td>2015-02-09</td><td>172103</td><td>Emily</td><td>Roman and Andrea were great hosts.

Description of accommodations was perfect.  We loved the neighborhood with all the different architecture of the homes. Tons of great places nearby for dining/drinking/coffee.  Also, neighborhood is well serviced by Uber if you want to go out and not worry about driving. Roman / Andrea's home is just around the corner from this amazing running/biking trail on the river which is perfect for a short or long run. Would definitely stay here the next time we're in Austin!</td></tr><tr><td>21361062</td><td>455434800</td><td>2019-05-19</td><td>259853129</td><td>Brandon</td><td>Absolutely great place to stay, very helpful with any and all questions.

He showed us the room and when I asked to see the kitchen and dining he said there are dogs on the other side so I held back and didn't ask any question. After he left I texted him to ask if there an iron, my wife need to press the clothes for next day for an event. He said the iron is in the garage and he would have to look around and will give it to me in the morning, and then I asked if I can use the kitchen to put milk and he never replied back. In the morning I called him and he said the kitchen is not for us to use, when I booked the room it showed that there is a kitchen, dining area and a backyard, later the pictures have been taken down and now I can see only the picture of the room, so no fridge for me to use to store milk for my kids. Then on top he said that i need to pay extra for my two kids, I asked him three day before that we will be bringing our two kids which was not originally planned and asked if it would be an issue. He didn't reply until the day of our travel and asked me to pay extra for the kids, the way he put it was if I pay him he will take $60 but if I use Airbnb they will charge me $120. I called airbnb and they said there is no additional charges for my kids, it was't in the contract when I book the trip, so he change the terms later knowing that he capitalize the situation. I never got the Iron and he even said he will give us the cooler for the milk and wrote about it on Airbrb to make it seem that he is being a good host by meeting our request. \r\n\r\nAnother thing my wife noticed that there sheets and cups were dirty. Well why bother putting cups there when you can't wash them. There were no trash can outside for us to at least throw the trash outside. \r\n\r\nI didn't complain and kept it quite, I didn't want to ruin my trip by arguing and getting into small things but the last word is mine. I had a very bad experience and I would not recommend anyone to stay there. He was a weird guy and I didn't get a good vibe from him. Another thing to note, the operating license was expired last year in August and was under some Lady name. How ever I want to make sure that Airbrb let the right people post the listing and show the what they are providing.  \r\n  \r\n</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>74958392</td><td>2016-05-17</td><td>70415373</td><td>Christopher</td><td>Peter was a great host. He was very knowledgeable about the area and knew a lot about the surrounding sites in Austin. I would highly recommend Peter to anyone who's looking for a place to stay in Austin.

I would definitely AirBnB here again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter is one of the nicest, warmest people I have had the pleasure of meeting in Austin. I travel to Austin for work, and decided to stay for the weekend with my boyfriend. We truly felt like we were getting the local experience – as if Peter's home were our own. The bed is comfortable and the room is fully stocked with a personal A/C unit, a Keurig machine, water, snacks, TV, and WiFi. We had a private bathroom stocked with toiletries (Khiel's face wash!), a hair dryer, curling iron... I think there might have even been some sort of aroma therapy. Besides the living/bathing quarters, Peter's house offers a full kitchen, living room, laundry room, backyard, parking spot AND a tiny house. Definitely request a tour of the Tiny House from Peter. It's pretty incredible – he also AirBnB's it out! Besides the physical accommodations, Peter's lovely dogs, Muddy and Penny were so fun to get to know. They were so sweet!\r\n\r\nIn terms of getting to know Austin as a local, Peter spent a lot of time getting to know us, answering questions, and providing suggestions of where to go in Austin. One morning, we ran into Peter at Figure 8, a great coffee shop just down the street from Peter's house, and we ended up chatting for about an hour over breakfast. It was awesome.\r\n\r\nThank you, Peter for helping to make our AirBnB stay so awesome!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>82058314</td><td>2016-06-26</td><td>38302225</td><td>Stephanie</td><td>Peter was a fantastic host!!

It was very nice to walk around and talk to neighbors and visit local restaurants and bars. It's too far to walk downtown (in my opinion) in August without expiring from heat exhaustion, but there is a bus from the Quicky Picky (as well as outstanding breakfast) and of course, local car shares like Fasten. I want to return soon!</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>99100382</td><td>2016-09-03</td><td>64308577</td><td>Vickie</td><td>Room was cutely decorated and bed was comfy!

During our stay there were some bumps, but my major concern is the bug bites we received throughout the stay. At first we thought it was the heat & mosquitos but after doing some comparisons it looks similar to bed bug bites.

She also brought us to a car rental station and to the airport at the end of our stay.She was always there  to answer all our questions. The appartment was perfectly located so we could really walk to 6th street and to other places in town were bands were playing. You do not need a car unless you want to go out of town.

I can't tell you know glad I was when I finally got off the plane at 11:30pm and saw that Sylvia was still waiting for me! \r\n\r\nMy stay with Sylvia was definitely one of the high points of my trip. Her studio was cozy, and I had a very good night's sleep. Sylvia definitely went out of her way to help me feel at home and comfortable, and there's really nothing I could say that would do justice to her hospitality. \r\n\r\nIf I have the chance to go back to Austin again, I will undoubtedly be staying at her studio. Meanwhile, I will tell all my friends about this wonderful place.</td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>34574</td><td>2010-04-10</td><td>90391</td><td>Hannah</td><td>A wonderful stay.

We were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to go and the apartment and Austin itself really felt like home by the time we had to leave. Sylvia was very helpful with giving us tips on where we might find interesting and it's obvious she really loves her town. We can't wait to go back! Barton Springs was definitely a highlight, as was the Broken Spoke for attempting to line-dance. After being on the road for a while having the space and independence of a whole apartment was wonderful.

The house itself has everything we needed for our stay and enough space for the three of us to comfortably hang out. The beds were so comfortable and the house was so clean. Sylvia has thoughtfully included beach towels, mats and kickboards (for Barton Springs), maps, and information on local activities. She is also a wealth of information about places to eat and things to do in the area.

I felt very safe because you go through two gates to get to the apartment, plus she has dogs.  The best part was the location - right on the edge of downtown, close enough to walk if you like or you can head up to the corner and catch the bus.  Definitely check out the bus schedule - we found Austin's public transportation to be great and really cheap - 2$ for an all day pass.  Sylvia was friendly and helpful, gave us some great advice for finding real Austin food.  And she has a drawer full of menus and flyers and local buying guides, and some classic VHS for when you want to chill out after a long day of exploring Austin.  Highly recommend. </td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>78493</td><td>2010-08-14</td><td>194474</td><td>Cathy</td><td>My daughter and I spent a couple of nights at Sylvia's place.  It was convenient, quiet and roomy for us. Helpful to have the kitchen and a stash of coffee in the frig that Sylvia was kind enough to provide.  The only suggestion I would make is that the air conditionner was not powerful enough to handle August heat in Austin. I would recommend a larger unit that would also handle the kitchen and bathroom. The bedroom got a bit hot at night...Other than that a good place to rest your head.</td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>79684</td><td>2010-08-16</td><td>194354</td><td>Yvonne</td><td>We spent a couple of days in Sylvia's wonderful little apartment.

Because of its age it is a little rustic when it comes to water temp in the shower, but it is cozy and cheerful. Anyone who likes historical homes (as I do) won't mind what is old but will find it charming.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean, we had everything we needed, plenty of space for the two of us, plus lots of privacy and quiet. Sylvia made sure we had enough fans in the room in addition to the air conditioner, which was really great for us because we are not acclimated to the hot, humid Texas summers.\r\n\r\nWe did not use it but the kitchen also had anything we might have needed. \r\n\r\nThe beds are soft which might be a concern for anyone with a bad back, but we slept great and there were plenty of pillows (Yay!).\r\n\r\nThe property is in a good location, not far from downtown, an easy drive from and to the airport, and it is also very close to a great Mexican cafe that stays open late, serves the real deal Mexican food for Great prices, all with really good service! We loved it.\r\n\r\nThanks Sylvia for contributing to our fun weekend in Austin. Your city rocks!</td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>87961</td><td>2010-08-31</td><td>191905</td><td>Jaysond</td><td>Wonderful location and a great little studio apartment.

One of the nights, Sylvia came and picked us up from Austin City Limits at night because the walk from the shuttle would have been too long at night!!

Close to a fab breakfast/brunch place called SNOOZE on S. Lamar. You must try! Best organic breakfast ever! Good south location. Walls are a little thin as it's a renovated older bldg. We heard people above us mostly and some walking by our front door as it's an apartment block but nothing to overtly complain about. Alarm was a little tricky for some reason. Quiet neighborhood overall however. Felt safe. Loved that it was all one level and easy access from parking spot very close by as I have a slight disability and can't climb stairs.

It's furniture shows Raquels great taste that is reflected all over the house as well. A nice private bathroom with a huge shower perfects the room.\nThe living room and the kitchen are really beatiful again. On thursdays the room is cleaned up. I honestly couldn't think of anything missing or any suggestions to make it better.\n\nLocation:\nThe location is pretty perfect. You have basically have a busstation in front of the house, that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes (line 6 / 12$ for a ticket that lasts a week). It's also in walking distance of a few nice foodtrucks, 2 bars and a small supermarket. And if you want quiet at night, it gives you that as well. Since it's a little of the main part (highway/downtown), nothing is distrubing you at night. All in all, it really couldn't have been better.\n\nWhat made the whole stay very special:\nThe Host(s):\nWow! If the room, the house and the location where great, Raquel and Ginger where the ones to make my stay into something truely special. From the first moment on, I felt welcome and was really happy to talk to them every time. Throughout my week it felt more and more like staying with friends. Coming home after a long day and having a nice chat about how our day was made the stay soooo special. Saying goodbye at the end of my stay had nothing to do with checking out, it was saying goodbye to friends!\n\nPS: Just to be complete here. It was always made very clear, that if I wanted my privacy, I could just go to my room and not participate in any conversation and neither Raquel nor Ginger would have been disappointed. Taking part in daily life was my decision and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it! Thanks Raquel and Ginger for being such good hosts and friends!</td></tr><tr><td>17609889</td><td>205760235</td><td>2017-10-22</td><td>149876535</td><td>Roslyn</td><td>This was an awesome place, you could not beat the location and we felt most of all it was safe.

Both Felise and her home had amazing personality. I came in with a friend for the weekend and one of the many highlights was just sitting around the kitchen table and conversing. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone as genuine and friendly. The house itself was very comfortable and served as a great home base for the weekend activities. </td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>175734108</td><td>2017-07-29</td><td>72917501</td><td>Daniel</td><td>Felise is the sweetest host you'll ever meet, she made us feel very comfortable and at home.

Thank you Felise for letting us shared the joy of feeding and visiting her feather friends. Awesome, awesome breakfast. Felise even went out of her way to make us a gourmet breakfast on Sunday. And her handmade wind chimes are unique pieces of arts. Best of all, we got to share our life stories together with Felise. You will not be disappointed staying with Felise.</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>179479677</td><td>2017-08-07</td><td>13205188</td><td>Lilly</td><td>We very much enjoyed our stay with Felise!

Feeding the chickens was a perk! </td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>182048854</td><td>2017-08-13</td><td>1118965</td><td>Ann</td><td>The description of this place is very accurate and the communication from the host, Felise, is excellent (responds quickly and gave us a tour).  It was exactly how I expected.  I appreciated that I was able to look through the kitchen window at nature while enjoying a drink in the morning.  She has a screened back porch where you can watch the chickens in the morning over a cup of coffee.  The house is very cozy, cute, and clean and also very quiet.  We had a question about Kerbey Lane locations and Felise was ready to look it up on line and print out the details for us.  We enjoyed staying here and found it to be a great deal.</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>182852699</td><td>2017-08-15</td><td>69715267</td><td>Amie</td><td>Felise's place was fantastic! She has a beautiful home and welcoming heart. It was super easy to communicate with Felise and she is very organized as to let you know what she expects from you as a guest and other accommodations. The room and bathroom were nice and very clean. The bed was super comfy. Oh, and I got to take home one of her beautiful and unique wind chimes that she makes herself. Even though it was only a short one night stay, we enjoyed our experience there. I would definitely stay with Felise again  and recommend her place to anyone! Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>185007909</td><td>2017-08-20</td><td>21466270</td><td>Kelly</td><td>We have stayed in so many airbnbs throughout the years, I cant keep count. With that said, Felise has been my favorite host out of every one of them. She loves what she does and she loves making her guests have the best experience possible. You can feel the care and thought put into everything in her house, down to the toilet paper being folded like they do at the fancy hotels. I enjoyed, more than I can express, sitting and talking to Felise during our stay, we had some good laughs and fun conversations. She truly is an amazing lady with a heart of pure gold. The communication was great before, during and after. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful yard with chairs to relax in. Felise showed us around the house and made sure any question we had were answered. Her house was spotless, I wish I could keep my house as clean! The bedroom is roomy with tons of space to put your luggage and other items. The bed was amazingly comfy and the sheets were divine. We had the whole bathroom to ourselves and she provided many extras for us to use which was a nice bonus. Felise offered us space in her fridge for our cold items which was so helpful! Her house is in a perfect location, we were going to the Palmer Event Center and she was just a short drive, close enough to the city where it was easy to access but far enough to escape the madness of it all. There are many places to shop, eat and explore within minutes of her house, the location was great! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, we were never woken through the night with outside noise. Perfect! The chickens and turkeys were so much fun to watch and feed. Felise introduced us to her beloved pets by name and allowed us to feed them. What a blast! It was so much fun sitting in the covered patio after a long day and watching them play and explore in her back yard. While in our bedroom, we never heard the chickens during our stay. Our last morning, Felise made us an amazing breakfast, delicious!!! It was by far the best meal of our weekend. Before we left, we got to pick an adorable wind chime, made special by Felise, to take home with us. She has a wonderful story in the bedroom about these chimes, please read it. There is so much love and care put into these wind chimes that I felt privileged to be able to take one home with me. She carefully packaged it up for us so we could transport it home safely. Our stay was perfect, I can not think of one thing that could be improved. Felise is an excellent host with excellent accommodations. I can not say enough good things about our stay, you will NOT be disappointed when staying here....</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>188787880</td><td>2017-08-30</td><td>139195990</td><td>Silas</td><td>Great place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>190703563</td><td>2017-09-04</td><td>39381883</td><td>Nini</td><td>Felise was warm and inviting. She provides a clean and enjoyable space.  The Chickens were fun and her couple of turkeys follow you around. I had to make some last minute adjustments to the trip for personal reasons and Felise was very understanding and compassionate. She is a bit strict on the rules, but she enforces them kindly and warmly. I did want to bring a dear friend over to meet the chickens, but no guests are allowed over to the house. All the amenities were wonderful and she stocked plenty of drinks, yogurt and bananas for us. I got to use her foam roller too. She makes wind chimes for a hobby and we got to take some with us, I even gave one to my dear friend in Austin.  I enjoyed her hospitality and would recommend this airbnb to everyone who wants a pleasant, safe, beautiful stay in a warm, unique and inviting place.</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>192631510</td><td>2017-09-10</td><td>80597549</td><td>Chloe</td><td>Great stay!

When I arrived at Felise's, I realized I booked my stay for the wrong day. When Airbnb dropped our call and didn't call us back the second time, Felise made sure my boyfriend and I were not turned away. She opened her home to us and let us use her own bedroom to rest our head, she made sure we were comfortable and that everything was perfect for us. If you ever have the chance to stay here, do it. She is an amazing person and loves beer so take her a bottle of your favorite brew. Also, the turkeys and chickens were an added bonus that made a great stay absolutely perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>194924306</td><td>2017-09-17</td><td>143927671</td><td>Arturo</td><td>Felise was incredibly sweet and welcoming she made us feel like we were at home.

It was Memorial Day, it was my birthday, and another host cancelled on me at 9:30 the day of. I had friends in from Dallas and Houston so I was super stressed. She didn't have time to get it cleaned before and was super transparent about helping me and giving me a discount because of it, so that was super awesome! Without her we wouldn't have had anywhere to go. If I wouldn't have gotten a coupon from Airbnb with this place I honestly don't think it is worth the price of 365 a night. It says it sleeps 6, but there was only one extra blanket. The water pressure in the kitchen was barely functioning, there are minimal dishes to actually cook, it states there is a hot tub, when really it is just a jacuzzi tub. It states there is a grill, but it didn't look like it would even work if we tried. It also states that it is good for kids, but there were many exposed wires and I had to keep an eye on the kids because some areas didn't feel totally safe. The hot water also didn't work which wasn't ideal. The blinds were all cracked and didn't even go down all the way in one of the rooms. Overall I think it is a great place if you are just looking for basic accommodation, but I don't feel that it was truly worth the price. Although I do very much appreciate the host being flexible and accommodating in a time of need I am leaving my honest review. Nonetheless we enjoyed our time there.</td></tr><tr><td>21361062</td><td>463127189</td><td>2019-06-02</td><td>223032931</td><td>Mark</td><td>The house was beautiful, Jane did an excellent job of communicating with me prior to the trip.

Since we couldn't connect to the wifi we couldn't connect to any stereo (at least they had three....but we couldn't use them). So I would pack a small one to use. We did message the owners and they responded right away! My husband talked to the owners and they were so helpful! They walked us through setting up the pool heater and tried to help with the wifi. It turns out it was the signal that wasn't working with At&t, so nothing anyone could really do. \nI would definitely stay here again!!! Plenty of space, wonderful pool, and great communication!</td></tr><tr><td>21366577</td><td>270097682</td><td>2018-05-28</td><td>11585628</td><td>Jared</td><td>Great house for families.

He also showed us the enclosed back yard for my grand dog. The area is very quiet. The best coffee shop in Austin is at the end of the street. We would walk there in the am for the most amazing coffee. Peter text us during our visit to make sure every thing was going good. The bed was amazing.

Even a 5 minute walk to a little East Side area with some food and beverage places. The spot its self was perfect for a couples getaway, all the amenities were nice and Peter even has everything you could want to snack on or drink already in the room. Toiletries too!

One of the best things i liked was that Peter worked with me to check in earlier and check out later. That was very helpful. Also his house is only a 15min walk to Franklin's bbq which if you dont know is the best in Austin. Gotta try it. I enjoyed the cable tv too. For future travelers, i'll say that this is a small spot....maybe 280sq.ft if that. Its the bed, bathroom/shower(good water pressure) and closet. Theres a microwave and a refrigerator too as well as a dresser to put your clothes in and thats it. The private entrance is great and you have this little spot to yourself. I try to be as thorough in my reviews as i can. Altogether a nice little spot.</td></tr><tr><td>21366577</td><td>425144830</td><td>2019-03-17</td><td>64792217</td><td>Alan</td><td>Great facilities... pool is amazing.

The neighborhood is very nice and quiet as it’s about 15/20 minutes from downtown. \nI stayed just for one night, it was a super last minute visit to ATX from Dallas to see friends. The check-in/out process was extremely easy. \nI didn’t get a chance to mention any of the small issues I had since I was only there for a couple hours enough to sleep a tiny bit and shower. \nThe lock to my bedroom didn’t work and the door wouldn’t close all the way, I had to put the desk chair against the door to keep it closed, not too big of deal but I’m just a very private person. And there was another guest staying in the other room. \nUnfortunately, the linens on my bed didn’t feel clean I had to shake them out. I was also greeted by a cockroach and silver fish on a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The House wasn’t dirty and it was nicely kept, I guess bugs just happen but I was still scared being half asleep.</td></tr><tr><td>13361970</td><td>259308791</td><td>2018-05-01</td><td>28529976</td><td>Emily</td><td>Angela's place is really great, as is Angela!

The suite was a perfect home base from which we could go out and explore Austin. It was the perfect size for just the two of us. The room was very clean, and there were a surprising amount of amenities. After spending all day out and about, it was great to come home and have a little snack. The toiletries were very helpful too! The location was ideal for us. The neighborhood is quiet and serene, but it's only a 10 minute walk to East 6th street and several great places to eat and drink, and there's a coffee shop just around the corner. We also were able to walk a bit farther to downtown without any difficulty (though if you're not used to walking a lot to get around, the ride share service FARE was always very reliable for us). Peter is a lively and friendly host who has traveled all over and has lots of stories.

The description of the apartment and the prior favorable reviews were all spot on: clean, comfortable living quarters loaded with amenities, and within walking distance or a short drive to many great bars and restaurants. Peter was a great host, quickly responding to pre-trip questions and great to talk to while we were there.  If Peter's place is available the next time we come to Austin, we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>133132799</td><td>2017-02-20</td><td>9216256</td><td>Abha</td><td>The location is in up and coming/hip East Austin.

The place itself is an additional room attached to the side of Peter's house. It is a tight/cozy room with a lot of extra treats like a stocked fridge, snacks, water, soap/shampoo, towels etc. Peter was a great communicator! Setting us up with a code to get in/out, and also making us aware of how to use the A/C/heat as well as informing us of other guests staying at his house.

This apartment has everything you need and a little more - Peter is a great host who makes sure there is always some water, beer and snacks for his guests. Check-in and check-out experience was also super smooth. The location in hip East Austin is perfect, away from crazy Downtown yet packed with great places to eat and have a drink.

Unfortunately, the bikes weren't available, which was too bad.  We ended up renting bikes.

The unit has a pleasant garden that's perfect for siestas and cervesas. Peter is a very attentive host and we felt that we could (and did) reach out to him whenever.

When you entire the Airbnb you will notice a cute layout filled with a bunch of amenities such as microwave, toaster oven, electric kettle, refrigerator, and a coffee maker. A nice and comfy bed awaits you, and right next to it a large desk to do work. This private space is a perfect size for a single traveler. Did I mention it has it's own highly efficient AC? Above all what really sets this place apart is the hospitality. Nader even gave me directions on some local good eats!

Situated on 2nd Street, just a few blocks from central downtown Austin, it's a five minute walk from the action, but also nice not to be in the middle of it. There are also some great restaurants on 2nd itself and if you want to check out the 'cookie' South Congress, that's only a 20 minute walk over the river. \r\n\r\nOverall a turnkey experience - it's all there. No problems at all and great views uptown from the apartment. You can even see the flashing lights of the historic Paramount Cinema, which I highly recommend checking out. </td></tr><tr><td>7344751</td><td>54518816</td><td>2015-11-21</td><td>47120780</td><td>Douglas</td><td>Beautiful apartment.

It is located in between South Congress and South First.  We were able to walk everywhere.  The house in on a street that is not a pass through, so there was not a lot of traffic.  There is a lot of construction in the neighboring houses, but it did not bother us.  The workers did work all weekend, but were courteous, and trucks did not block the driveway.   In the Travis Heights area, construction is probably to be expected.  The house was very clean, with a lot of high end features.  It provided ample space for our family of 10.  The gate and driveway is very useful, so you don't have to park in the street.\n\nWe would definitely stay here again...I'm sure by then the construction next door will be completed.  Great house.</td></tr><tr><td>7345104</td><td>131265626</td><td>2017-02-11</td><td>14589982</td><td>Megan</td><td>This was the perfect home for our business travel trip!

Owner was defensive and “technical” in his description of the heap saying “this is exactly what I advertised”.  Ignore his phony hospitality. \n\nTerry, Terry, good ol’ TERRY. Whatever you do, stay away from this Airbnb. We had a group of 12 young professionals looking forward to the one weekend a year where we do a fantasy football destination draft.  The group had moderate expectations and we were overwhelmingly disappointed.   I was the last to arrive, and before I boarded my flight, my buddies were sending me pictures of this pathetic unit and asking for a refund for the over sized dorm room. The owner, Terry, was as responsive as he was defensive and provided no help except for “access” to the pool next door (another overwhelming pile that wasn't worth the walk).  We regret paying even a quarter of the price for this falsely advertised dorm room sauna.  \n\nAs dramatic as the review seems, its factual and represents the feelings of all 12 members of the group.  Would love to post actual pictures if allowed to. \n\nBest,\n\nSmuth</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>46924798</td><td>2015-09-14</td><td>1654417</td><td>Bryan</td><td>The home was beautiful - nestled in a really fun part of Austin between South Congress and South Lamar (both of which you could spend a weekend exploring). We stayed for the weekend and on Saturday evening we took a quick taxi ride downtown, ate and then did some bar hopping on 6th street. Basically this place is in a perfect location for Austin.\r\n\r\nI'll also throw out there that the host, Alex, went out of his way to make our stay great. He was flexible with us on checkin and checkout, he was always responsive when we had questions. Also, when he found out I was getting married in two weeks, he gave us a wedding gift in the form of a partial refund on our stay. It was super nice and completely unexpected.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a house in South Austin that's close to just about everything and managed by a fantastic host, I'd highly recommend this place - you won't be disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>48004721</td><td>2015-09-22</td><td>34139644</td><td>Brion</td><td>Our stay at this home was fabulous! Our host went above and beyond our expectations, even purchasing and assembling a new grill to accommodate our family's needs. The home was clean, comfortable and spacious! Our host was available at all times and answered all of our questions and was very helpful. He left us yummy homemade bread and soft drinks in the refrigerator. I plan on staying there in the future. I can recommend this home to anyone considering staying in Austin.</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>50693183</td><td>2015-10-13</td><td>2213191</td><td>Sloane</td><td>I cannot recommend Alex's place highly enough! I came for ACL with a big group and thought this would be a better option than booking hotels for everyone. It certainly was - we slept 6 people here comfortably, and we were an easy 10 minute drive from the venue. The house was big and comfortable, very clean and well kept, and with every amenity you could want (lovely kitchen, coffee maker, laundry room, TV and wifi etc.) Alex even stocked the fridge with drinks for us and made a bunch of Lebanese snacks that saved us when we came home late and tired and hungry :) and stocked the showers with toiletries, etc. \nAlex was an ideal host and was very communicative and courteous, always checking in to see if there was anything he could do to make our stay more comfortable. We will definitely stay here again next time we're in Austin!</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>51283496</td><td>2015-10-19</td><td>27217944</td><td>Francie</td><td>This was my first Air B&B and it could not have worked out better. Marwa and Alex were great hosts and made sure that everything about the stay was perfect. They left us some unique treats to snack on when we got in, allowed a late check out, and sent the items we left the next day, without charge!\r\n\r\nThe house felt brand new and had plenty of space for our part of 8. The house is in a quiet residential area about a 10-15 minute car ride to downtown so I would recommend getting a rental car if you want to explore the city. \r\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend this rental for family's or groups of friends who are visiting Austin.</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>51817157</td><td>2015-10-24</td><td>6117101</td><td>Joel</td><td>great place to stay. felt like a king. \r\n\r\nAlex was very hospitable </td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>52175738</td><td>2015-10-26</td><td>44167072</td><td>Kirk And Candace</td><td>Alex was a fantastic host, the home is the most equipped I have ever stayed in.

We had some initial issues with refrigerator space, amenities and other minor issues like WiFi access and pool operation which were resolved within a few days allowing us to focus on enjoying the holiday. The pool area is a great relaxation space which could do with more pool side loungers for bigger groups like our family of 6 but I was aware of this upon booking.

Xavier really did everything he could to make our stay a pleasant one. He offered pickup at the airport, delivered fresh pastries and responded quick to any questions we had. I arrived at the airport without baggage (thanks United!), but Xavier offered to take me out to buy clothes and necessities. He even offered to lend me his clothes to help me out.

You can easily walk to several restaurants, an Irish bar, and a grocery store. If you're needing to get around the neighborhood quickly, but don't want to drive, there's hundreds of lime or bird scooters scattered around. We used them everyday! Free parking was one of my biggest reasons for ditching something outside of downtown. I also thought it was fairly fast (15 minutes, non-highway) to get to downtown which makes the location ideal to get out of the craziness, but keep you close to the action you wanted to see. I loved that the owner's had some extra household amenities especially since it didn't make sense for us to go shopping for items we only needed for 2 days. Unit was nice, clean, and comfy. Perfect for a couple. I would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>26716344</td><td>356583248</td><td>2018-12-08</td><td>123980067</td><td>Martha</td><td>Everything was perfect.

The space was stylish, clean and nicely furnished. The property is brand new & has great amenities such as a swimming pool, gym &  24/7 onsite security.\n\nKyle & Bryttie were also great hosts! I received detailed directions on how to access the property & they even checked-in to make sure everything was as expected.

The communication was outstanding.  The condo is gorgeous!  I know this property is new for them and in a developing area.  Check-in wasn't super easy (simply because of the building itself and the security (which is nice).  However, Kyle stepped up and walked me through it on the phone when I needed to quickly check in and get to a meeting.  No complaints at all.  I was disappointed the pool was closed during my stay (as I chose the place planning to use the pool), but this was out of their control.  I loved the proximity to downtown without all the busy traffic surrounding me.  Uber rides to my downtown conference were $6-$7 each and I even used the Lime scooters several times which took me only 8-9 minutes to reach my meetings. There were great little drinking and dining options within a very short walking distance.  If I return to Austin (which is likely next year - maybe sooner on vacation), I would definitely stay with Kyle and Bryttie again.

It was a quiet residential area and I was able to park my car (full of belongings) and not worry about it. We did have to uber to a lot of places but Uber was extremely cheap.

Literally and figuratively. The decor has a light Austin vintage/rancher feel.  Loved the retro TV and record player, and especially the toilet seat! The bed is unbelievably comfortable. I found myself looking forward to going to sleep because it was so delicious. \n\nThe single room is on a very quiet residential street near a great artist/hipster haunt called Figure8 coffee house. Its a strait shot to downtown so that you don't even need to get on a freeway. Location on the East side gives you some breathing room from the sometimes oppressive college atmosphere of downtown's UT contingency. \n\nThe indispensable AC system for the room was unbelievable. Usually AC at overnight places is not enough or way too much, but Peter has installed a killer Mitsubishi cooler that you can adjust for quick results and without drying out your sinuses. Plenty of plugs and great wireless for business-ing.\n\nPeter made a point of meeting me personally, which not all hosts bother to do. He made some personalized recommendations of spots to check out and gave me some pointers on breakfast, which were spot on.</td></tr><tr><td>3862246</td><td>172675295</td><td>2017-07-21</td><td>68171360</td><td>Emily</td><td>Peter is a great host.

The house was amazing and our little studio was perfect for the weekend. The bed was comfortable and the little love seat and TV was perfect for relaxing after so many busy events. The neighborhood was great and close to everything. We walked to an amazing breakfast spot, Cenote each morning and had the best coffee and breakfast. It was only about a 20 minute walk from the house. Everything else we needed to get to in Austin was close. We took Ubers everywhere and it was only abou $4-7 each way to get to Rainy St, downtown, etc. Roman and Andrea's place was my first airbnb and it was awesome.

The studio and the exterior space is just beautiful! \r\n\r\nAlso, the studio is in a great location!

This is our favorite spot to stay in Austin. It's super clean and just minutes from 6th/ Rainey Street. Roman and Andrea are available when you need them, easy to communicate with, but you still have tons of privacy.\r\n\r\nThey also have a super cute dog :)</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>31276726</td><td>2015-05-03</td><td>2132863</td><td>Ben</td><td>Only met Andrea, but she was very pleasant and accommodating! \r\n\r\nThe place was fantastic - simple, clean, comfortable, and totally removed from main house, which is modern and awesome.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is also just great - really cool bars and restaurants within walking distance.</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>32286043</td><td>2015-05-16</td><td>212479</td><td>Jon</td><td>This is a great little place; the house is very smartly designed -- comfortable and clean. Roman and Andrea were great hosts (and we loved their pup Chandler), responding quickly to any questions and quick to offer restaurant recommendations (The Launderette was so good, and it's only a couple of blocks away). We'll definitely try to stay there next time we're in Austin. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>32833695</td><td>2015-05-22</td><td>9736643</td><td>Abby</td><td>Andrea and Roman were incredibly responsive.

Can't ask for much more! Roman greeted me and got me settled and left me to do my thing, but remained readily available via text. \n\nApproximately 5-10 minutes and $5 to take an uber into town.; 15 minutes and $15 to the airport.\n\nCheck out Kebabalicious on E. 7th or \"El Sol y la Luna\" downtown on 6th... My two fav eats from my stay! </td></tr><tr><td>977492</td><td>40822831</td><td>2015-08-02</td><td>13350717</td><td>Anastasia</td><td>Roman & Andrea were awesome! They were out of town for the duration of our stay, but you would never know because Roman was so attentive and only a text away. He answered all of our questions promptly and even gave us recommendations for must-try restaurants.

The space was clean and the location was great. We brought our bikes and literally biked everywhere... dinner, downtown, hike and bike trail, etc. Highly recommend dining at Launderette for brunch. We had a minor issue and the owners were very apologetic, responsive, and compensated us for it.</td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>217567</td><td>2011-04-04</td><td>469745</td><td>Monica</td><td>Sylvia's studio apt was very cute, clean and comfortable. It was very close to downtown and a great deal! I would definitely recommend this place- even though it's near the interstate, it was very quiet and a peaceful spot to come back to after partying or walking all day. Very nice VHS collection, books and maps of Austin!

A great deal of love and artistry has gone into her home and yard. I found my stay in this warm and natural setting relaxing and invigorating; healing. You get a wind chime and you get to feed the turkeys. That's right. But most of all you might get to meet this delightful receiving person. I’d urge you to stay awhile.</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>197070363</td><td>2017-09-24</td><td>61605036</td><td>Ana</td><td>My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay with mama Felise.  We felt so welcomed even though we arrived late in the evening & she took the time to explain all the details of her home. Felise is a very accommodating and gracious host.  A lovely breakfast with coffee was prepared both mornings we were there.  Watching  the chickens at play was very entertaining.  Our room was very clean and quiet and the bed, comfortable. We never saw her indoor pets during our stay. The location was very convenient to us as it was right off the HWY.  It was hard to pick a wind chime, that she made, as they were all so pretty. So we let her select one for us. When we left we thanked her for the stay and we felt as we just visited a friend. We would enjoy staying with her again when we visit Austin.  </td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>128303</td><td>2010-10-27</td><td>12386</td><td>Adrian</td><td>Sylvia is very hospitable and that's why the rating has stars.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood didn't feel walkable on Sunday: many places were closed when I went out, including the BBQ place mentioned in the guide.  I also didn't see anyone else \"walking\" near the place, except people asking me for money.\r\n\r\nThe cottage fell short of our expectations, considering we stayed in thrilling soco, in an insect-free modern cabin, for less money the two nights prior.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you want to be in walking distance to the convention center and/or are in need of two beds, this place could be worth a look.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.ml import Pipeline\nimport sparknlp\nsparknlp.start()\nfrom sparknlp.base import

The private entry to the room was great and added to the overall comfort level I felt.  I'd love to stay there again and plan to book again!

When I arrived he was genuine and personable as he greeted me and showed me the features of the suite, making sure I was familiar with how the TV, A/C, etc. worked.  He stressed that for any question I had during my stay, I could just call or text him and he would be more than happy to help.  The listing was extremely accurate and, though the exact location is not given, his mention of the house's proximity to a well known coffee shop (which he listed by name-Figure 8) was very useful in getting an idea of where the place was located.  The photos are slightly dated but everything not pictured has been listed in the photo descriptions and if anything, the suite is nicer now than in the pictures.  There have been additions since the pictures were taken of: an AT&T U-Verse equipped TV facing the bed, a chair along the same wall as the one the restroom door is on, a table next to the entry door with a Keurig coffee maker & snacks, additional wall artwork and a lamp on the bedside table on the wall between the bed and the restroom.  The bathroom is stocked with high-end products and the water pressure/quantity in the shower is truly unbelievable.  The neighborhood is good.  The East side of Austin is \"coming up\", so to speak, and has progressed substantially in that regard.  There are plenty of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. within easy walking distance.  My Uber ride to meet friends at the Westin downtown (at 5th & San Jacinto) cost me $7.41 in peak traffic and we had to re-route due to street closures for an event which was not bad at all.  Overall, this place was great.  I found it better and cheaper than a hotel downtown and Peter was very accommodating, especially for a first-time user of Airbnb.    </td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 126, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5391), List()), List(sentiment, 129, 292, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4800), List()), List(sentiment, 295, 420, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5139), List()), List(sentiment, 423, 668, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5100), List()), List(sentiment, 671, 831, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5042), List()), List(sentiment, 834, 1170, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5099), List()), List(sentiment, 1173, 1287, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4774), List()), List(sentiment, 1290, 1314, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5600), List()), List(sentiment, 1317, 1417, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5067), List()), List(sentiment, 1420, 1506, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5694), List()), List(sentiment, 1509, 1697, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5545), List()), List(sentiment, 1700, 1729, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4790), List()), List(sentiment, 1732, 1860, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5017), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Peter was terrific!

When I did check-in, I knocked and messaged my host that I arrived. Yet, I waited over 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I did NOT receive any prior instructions before. I was lucky enough to check an area that had the key to get in. His excuse, he forgot. As soon as I entered the door, I get this foul odor and don't know where it is coming from. I then check the beds and they look unmade, which don't know even if they are clean or not (I asked about it, which my host said that they were). I go into the restroom it is untidy overall along with crap stains in toilet. I go into the kitchen to try to figure out where that smell is coming from. The kitchen is also unkempt, which food stains and food pieces all over the oven and microwave counter. So I call my host to tell him about the smell. He apologized and claimed the guy who manages he place would come after work (did not give me an exact time) to clean up. And he himself could not come since he was out of town. So he told me to go ahead and throw away food in the frig if I wanted to or take out the trash already there. So I did throw some items out and took out the trash in common area and in one of the bedrooms...But if your guest feels more like the cleaning lady than your guest, then you are WRONG. I could not stand the smell so I had to leave and buy SOMETHING to get that odor out, which I had to bomb the place with eliminating-odor products to get the smell at tolerable levels. I spent at least $20 on cleaning supplies (was not compensated for it even after my stay). My host's management (one guy that does the 'tidy' up) never came to check up on me that night or the next day day to follow-up. Although my host did inform me since I did not have my light on, his management assumed I was sleeping that night. Yet I would have appreciated the next day follow-up. Again, that did NOT happen. I will say this host was nice, amiable, communicative (not at first), and respectful when I talked to him over the phone. He felted bad about my experience and was constantly apologizing for it. He gave me a 1/3 reduced price off after (still not enough) & even offered the next night free (which I had already booked another reservation already). I just wished he would have taken more initiative to correct my issues immediately or prior to my arrival. So the take away from my bad experience? If you want a taste of that college experience, this is it!

Bus line is steps away.  Uber/Lyft rides are $7-$9 to/from there and about $20 to/from the airport.  Uber is easier to get than Lyft during peak times.  Every driver and friend who came by commented how cool the house looks.  Neighborhood appears to be at the start of a revitalization where one or two homes on the block are renovated and the others not, but it feels safe.  I walked it every morning to exercise and explore.  There's also a big park about two blocks south, right along the river.\r\n\r\nSpace looks just like the photos.  Clean and bright.  Private.  Surprisingly comfortable bed... just be nimble enough to navigate up and down the ladder.\r\n\r\nWish there were a closet and/or drawers.  A mini refrigerator and a microwave would've been nice, too.  I stayed for four nights and those things would've been convenient.\r\n\r\nThe only glitch was during my arrival.  I'd contacted them about a week in advance to discuss procedures and at that time disclosed my arrival plans around 1 p.m.  Check in/out was listed as \"flexible,\" and they said that was fine, but when I touched down at the airport, I got a text apologizing, saying check-in isn't normally until 4 and could I come at 3 because the other tenant hadn't checked out yet.  I wasn't planning on wandering Austin with a suitcase for two hours, and I really just needed to drop my things off (and charge my phone) before going downtown.  I arrived just before the previous tenants and they were apologetic, saying they left to go for coffee and decided to do some sight-seeing before checking out and the time got away from them.  I think it was more awkward for them than for me.  It would've been a big deal if I were exhausted and needed a shower or to sleep, but I literally dropped off my bag, charged my phone and went straight back out until later that evening.  \r\n\r\nI had a great stay.

He showed us the room and when I asked to see the kitchen and dining he said there are dogs on the other side so I held back and didn't ask any question. After he left I texted him to ask if there an iron, my wife need to press the clothes for next day for an event. He said the iron is in the garage and he would have to look around and will give it to me in the morning, and then I asked if I can use the kitchen to put milk and he never replied back. In the morning I called him and he said the kitchen is not for us to use, when I booked the room it showed that there is a kitchen, dining area and a backyard, later the pictures have been taken down and now I can see only the picture of the room, so no fridge for me to use to store milk for my kids. Then on top he said that i need to pay extra for my two kids, I asked him three day before that we will be bringing our two kids which was not originally planned and asked if it would be an issue. He didn't reply until the day of our travel and asked me to pay extra for the kids, the way he put it was if I pay him he will take $60 but if I use Airbnb they will charge me $120. I called airbnb and they said there is no additional charges for my kids, it was't in the contract when I book the trip, so he change the terms later knowing that he capitalize the situation. I never got the Iron and he even said he will give us the cooler for the milk and wrote about it on Airbrb to make it seem that he is being a good host by meeting our request. \r\n\r\nAnother thing my wife noticed that there sheets and cups were dirty. Well why bother putting cups there when you can't wash them. There were no trash can outside for us to at least throw the trash outside. \r\n\r\nI didn't complain and kept it quite, I didn't want to ruin my trip by arguing and getting into small things but the last word is mine.

You will feel at home. I would definitely AirBnB here again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter is one of the nicest, warmest people I have had the pleasure of meeting in Austin. I travel to Austin for work, and decided to stay for the weekend with my boyfriend. We truly felt like we were getting the local experience – as if Peter's home were our own. The bed is comfortable and the room is fully stocked with a personal A/C unit, a Keurig machine, water, snacks, TV, and WiFi. We had a private bathroom stocked with toiletries (Khiel's face wash!), a hair dryer, curling iron... I think there might have even been some sort of aroma therapy. Besides the living/bathing quarters, Peter's house offers a full kitchen, living room, laundry room, backyard, parking spot AND a tiny house. Definitely request a tour of the Tiny House from Peter. It's pretty incredible – he also AirBnB's it out! Besides the physical accommodations, Peter's lovely dogs, Muddy and Penny were so fun to get to know. They were so sweet!\r\n\r\nIn terms of getting to know Austin as a local, Peter spent a lot of time getting to know us, answering questions, and providing suggestions of where to go in Austin. One morning, we ran into Peter at Figure 8, a great coffee shop just down the street from Peter's house, and we ended up chatting for about an hour over breakfast. It was awesome.\r\n\r\nThank you, Peter for helping to make our AirBnB stay so awesome!\r\n</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 2, 4, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6666), List()), List(sentiment, 5, 23, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5282), List()), List(sentiment, 25, 46, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5125), List()), List(sentiment, 48, 84, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5399), List()), List(sentiment, 91, 178, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5354), List()), List(sentiment, 180, 262, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4926), List()), List(sentiment, 264, 353, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5880), List()), List(sentiment, 355, 479, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5105), List()), List(sentiment, 481, 581, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6001), List()), List(sentiment, 583, 644, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5016), List()), List(sentiment, 646, 786, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4938), List()), List(sentiment, 788, 842, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4777), List()), List(sentiment, 844, 892, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5404), List()), List(sentiment, 894, 994, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5008), List()), List(sentiment, 996, 1014, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7178), List()), List(sentiment, 1019, 1183, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4804), List()), List(sentiment, 1185, 1347, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5275), List()), List(sentiment, 1349, 1363, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6133), List()), List(sentiment, 1368, 1431, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6413), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Peter was a fantastic host!!

You have basically have a busstation in front of the house, that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes (line 6 / 12$ for a ticket that lasts a week). It's also in walking distance of a few nice foodtrucks, 2 bars and a small supermarket. And if you want quiet at night, it gives you that as well. Since it's a little of the main part (highway/downtown), nothing is distrubing you at night. All in all, it really couldn't have been better.\n\nWhat made the whole stay very special:\nThe Host(s):\nWow! If the room, the house and the location where great, Raquel and Ginger where the ones to make my stay into something truely special. From the first moment on, I felt welcome and was really happy to talk to them every time. Throughout my week it felt more and more like staying with friends. Coming home after a long day and having a nice chat about how our day was made the stay soooo special. Saying goodbye at the end of my stay had nothing to do with checking out, it was saying goodbye to friends!\n\nPS: Just to be complete here. It was always made very clear, that if I wanted my privacy, I could just go to my room and not participate in any conversation and neither Raquel nor Ginger would have been disappointed. Taking part in daily life was my decision and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it!

You can feel the care and thought put into everything in her house, down to the toilet paper being folded like they do at the fancy hotels. I enjoyed, more than I can express, sitting and talking to Felise during our stay, we had some good laughs and fun conversations. She truly is an amazing lady with a heart of pure gold. The communication was great before, during and after. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful yard with chairs to relax in. Felise showed us around the house and made sure any question we had were answered. Her house was spotless, I wish I could keep my house as clean! The bedroom is roomy with tons of space to put your luggage and other items. The bed was amazingly comfy and the sheets were divine. We had the whole bathroom to ourselves and she provided many extras for us to use which was a nice bonus. Felise offered us space in her fridge for our cold items which was so helpful! Her house is in a perfect location, we were going to the Palmer Event Center and she was just a short drive, close enough to the city where it was easy to access but far enough to escape the madness of it all. There are many places to shop, eat and explore within minutes of her house, the location was great! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, we were never woken through the night with outside noise. Perfect! The chickens and turkeys were so much fun to watch and feed. Felise introduced us to her beloved pets by name and allowed us to feed them. What a blast! It was so much fun sitting in the covered patio after a long day and watching them play and explore in her back yard. While in our bedroom, we never heard the chickens during our stay. Our last morning, Felise made us an amazing breakfast, delicious!!! It was by far the best meal of our weekend. Before we left, we got to pick an adorable wind chime, made special by Felise, to take home with us. She has a wonderful story in the bedroom about these chimes, please read it. There is so much love and care put into these wind chimes that I felt privileged to be able to take one home with me. She carefully packaged it up for us so we could transport it home safely. Our stay was perfect, I can not think of one thing that could be improved. Felise is an excellent host with excellent accommodations.

It was Memorial Day, it was my birthday, and another host cancelled on me at 9:30 the day of. I had friends in from Dallas and Houston so I was super stressed. She didn't have time to get it cleaned before and was super transparent about helping me and giving me a discount because of it, so that was super awesome! Without her we wouldn't have had anywhere to go. If I wouldn't have gotten a coupon from Airbnb with this place I honestly don't think it is worth the price of 365 a night. It says it sleeps 6, but there was only one extra blanket. The water pressure in the kitchen was barely functioning, there are minimal dishes to actually cook, it states there is a hot tub, when really it is just a jacuzzi tub. It states there is a grill, but it didn't look like it would even work if we tried. It also states that it is good for kids, but there were many exposed wires and I had to keep an eye on the kids because some areas didn't feel totally safe. The hot water also didn't work which wasn't ideal. The blinds were all cracked and didn't even go down all the way in one of the rooms. Overall I think it is a great place if you are just looking for basic accommodation, but I don't feel that it was truly worth the price. Although I do very much appreciate the host being flexible and accommodating in a time of need I am leaving my honest review. Nonetheless we enjoyed our time there.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 28, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7493), List()), List(sentiment, 30, 122, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5043), List()), List(sentiment, 124, 188, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 190, 344, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5591), List()), List(sentiment, 346, 393, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 395, 517, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5335), List()), List(sentiment, 519, 576, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 578, 745, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 829, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5379), List()), List(sentiment, 831, 986, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 988, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5304), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1122, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5014), List()), List(sentiment, 1124, 1259, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5358), List()), List(sentiment, 1261, 1385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4693), List()), List(sentiment, 1387, 1424, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5324), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>The house was beautiful, Jane did an excellent job of communicating with me prior to the trip.

If more people are checking in or out at the same time, it's better to walk the 10 flights.\n\n1. ) The condo was extremely cramped and beaten.  \n\n2.) Beds and pillows were worn.  If you want additional bedding there are literally 4 mattresses that you have to throw on the floor.\n\n3.) The air conditioner was barely functional, even while set at the regulated 67 degrees, causing the place to near outdoor temperatures.  \n\n4.) The pool was literally lime green and locked closed.  Had it not been closed, the pool looked like it was the public pool in “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and wouldn't have been worth a dip.\n\n5.) The loft had 2 broken blinds and other damage from previous tenants and the owner tried charging us for them.\n\n6.) The balcony was nearly nonexistent and overlooked the neighbor’s dumpsters and rooftop.  For reference, people were storing a kayak on its side in one of the units and it barely fit.  \n\n7.) Owner was defensive and “technical” in his description of the heap saying “this is exactly what I advertised”.  Ignore his phony hospitality. \n\nTerry, Terry, good ol’ TERRY. Whatever you do, stay away from this Airbnb. We had a group of 12 young professionals looking forward to the one weekend a year where we do a fantasy football destination draft.  The group had moderate expectations and we were overwhelmingly disappointed.   I was the last to arrive, and before I boarded my flight, my buddies were sending me pictures of this pathetic unit and asking for a refund for the over sized dorm room. The owner, Terry, was as responsive as he was defensive and provided no help except for “access” to the pool next door (another overwhelming pile that wasn't worth the walk).  We regret paying even a quarter of the price for this falsely advertised dorm room sauna.  \n\nAs dramatic as the review seems, its factual and represents the feelings of all 12 members of the group.

You can easily walk to several restaurants, an Irish bar, and a grocery store. If you're needing to get around the neighborhood quickly, but don't want to drive, there's hundreds of lime or bird scooters scattered around. We used them everyday! Free parking was one of my biggest reasons for ditching something outside of downtown. I also thought it was fairly fast (15 minutes, non-highway) to get to downtown which makes the location ideal to get out of the craziness, but keep you close to the action you wanted to see. I loved that the owner's had some extra household amenities especially since it didn't make sense for us to go shopping for items we only needed for 2 days. Unit was nice, clean, and comfy.

I found myself looking forward to going to sleep because it was so delicious. \n\nThe single room is on a very quiet residential street near a great artist/hipster haunt called Figure8 coffee house. Its a strait shot to downtown so that you don't even need to get on a freeway. Location on the East side gives you some breathing room from the sometimes oppressive college atmosphere of downtown's UT contingency. \n\nThe indispensable AC system for the room was unbelievable. Usually AC at overnight places is not enough or way too much, but Peter has installed a killer Mitsubishi cooler that you can adjust for quick results and without drying out your sinuses. Plenty of plugs and great wireless for business-ing.\n\nPeter made a point of meeting me personally, which not all hosts bother to do. He made some personalized recommendations of spots to check out and gave me some pointers on breakfast, which were spot on.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 55, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5216), List()), List(sentiment, 57, 83, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5229), List()), List(sentiment, 85, 134, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5328), List()), List(sentiment, 137, 205, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5197), List()), List(sentiment, 207, 242, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4429), List()), List(sentiment, 244, 320, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5499), List()), List(sentiment, 324, 439, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5565), List()), List(sentiment, 441, 518, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5168), List()), List(sentiment, 520, 653, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5400), List()), List(sentiment, 657, 714, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5654), List()), List(sentiment, 716, 902, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4773), List()), List(sentiment, 904, 955, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4832), List()), List(sentiment, 958, 1035, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5423), List()), List(sentiment, 1037, 1159, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5464), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Peter is a great host.

He stressed that for any question I had during my stay, I could just call or text him and he would be more than happy to help.  The listing was extremely accurate and, though the exact location is not given, his mention of the house's proximity to a well known coffee shop (which he listed by name-Figure 8) was very useful in getting an idea of where the place was located.

The bathroom is stocked with high-end products and the water pressure/quantity in the shower is truly unbelievable.  The neighborhood is good.

Biking in the area is great too; it's about a 15-minute bike ride to/from Downtown. Paddy was kind enough to drive me to a bike rental shop.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is a bit eclectic with a mixture of Austin locals, artists and activists. I was fortunate to be there the same weekend as East Austin Studio Tours (EAST), which gave me a chance to explore that section of Austin.

When I did check-in, I knocked and messaged my host that I arrived. Yet, I waited over 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I did NOT receive any prior instructions before. I was lucky enough to check an area that had the key to get in. His excuse, he forgot. As soon as I entered the door, I get this foul odor and don't know where it is coming from. I then check the beds and they look unmade, which don't know even if they are clean or not (I asked about it, which my host said that they were). I go into the restroom it is untidy overall along with crap stains in toilet. I go into the kitchen to try to figure out where that smell is coming from. The kitchen is also unkempt, which food stains and food pieces all over the oven and microwave counter. So I call my host to tell him about the smell. He apologized and claimed the guy who manages he place would come after work (did not give me an exact time) to clean up. And he himself could not come since he was out of town. So he told me to go ahead and throw away food in the frig if I wanted to or take out the trash already there. So I did throw some items out and took out the trash in common area and in one of the bedrooms...But if your guest feels more like the cleaning lady than your guest, then you are WRONG. I could not stand the smell so I had to leave and buy SOMETHING to get that odor out, which I had to bomb the place with eliminating-odor products to get the smell at tolerable levels. I spent at least $20 on cleaning supplies (was not compensated for it even after my stay). My host's management (one guy that does the 'tidy' up) never came to check up on me that night or the next day day to follow-up. Although my host did inform me since I did not have my light on, his management assumed I was sleeping that night. Yet I would have appreciated the next day follow-up. Again, that did NOT happen. I will say this host was nice, amiable, communicative (not at first), and respectful when I talked to him over the phone. He felted bad about my experience and was constantly apologizing for it. He gave me a 1/3 reduced price off after (still not enough) & even offered the next night free (which I had already booked another reservation already). I just wished he would have taken more initiative to correct my issues immediately or prior to my arrival. So the take away from my bad experience?

I wasn't planning on wandering Austin with a suitcase for two hours, and I really just needed to drop my things off (and charge my phone) before going downtown.  I arrived just before the previous tenants and they were apologetic, saying they left to go for coffee and decided to do some sight-seeing before checking out and the time got away from them.  I think it was more awkward for them than for me.  It would've been a big deal if I were exhausted and needed a shower or to sleep, but I literally dropped off my bag, charged my phone and went straight back out until later that evening.  \r\n\r\nI had a great stay.

He showed us the room and when I asked to see the kitchen and dining he said there are dogs on the other side so I held back and didn't ask any question. After he left I texted him to ask if there an iron, my wife need to press the clothes for next day for an event. He said the iron is in the garage and he would have to look around and will give it to me in the morning, and then I asked if I can use the kitchen to put milk and he never replied back. In the morning I called him and he said the kitchen is not for us to use, when I booked the room it showed that there is a kitchen, dining area and a backyard, later the pictures have been taken down and now I can see only the picture of the room, so no fridge for me to use to store milk for my kids. Then on top he said that i need to pay extra for my two kids, I asked him three day before that we will be bringing our two kids which was not originally planned and asked if it would be an issue. He didn't reply until the day of our travel and asked me to pay extra for the kids, the way he put it was if I pay him he will take $60 but if I use Airbnb they will charge me $120. I called airbnb and they said there is no additional charges for my kids, it was't in the contract when I book the trip, so he change the terms later knowing that he capitalize the situation. I never got the Iron and he even said he will give us the cooler for the milk and wrote about it on Airbrb to make it seem that he is being a good host by meeting our request. \r\n\r\nAnother thing my wife noticed that there sheets and cups were dirty. Well why bother putting cups there when you can't wash them. There were no trash can outside for us to at least throw the trash outside. \r\n\r\nI didn't complain and kept it quite, I didn't want to ruin my trip by arguing and getting into small things but the last word is mine. I had a very bad experience and I would not recommend anyone to stay there. He was a weird guy and I didn't get a good vibe from him.

I travel to Austin for work, and decided to stay for the weekend with my boyfriend. We truly felt like we were getting the local experience – as if Peter's home were our own. The bed is comfortable and the room is fully stocked with a personal A/C unit, a Keurig machine, water, snacks, TV, and WiFi. We had a private bathroom stocked with toiletries (Khiel's face wash!), a hair dryer, curling iron... I think there might have even been some sort of aroma therapy. Besides the living/bathing quarters, Peter's house offers a full kitchen, living room, laundry room, backyard, parking spot AND a tiny house. Definitely request a tour of the Tiny House from Peter. It's pretty incredible – he also AirBnB's it out! Besides the physical accommodations, Peter's lovely dogs, Muddy and Penny were so fun to get to know. They were so sweet!\r\n\r\nIn terms of getting to know Austin as a local, Peter spent a lot of time getting to know us, answering questions, and providing suggestions of where to go in Austin. One morning, we ran into Peter at Figure 8, a great coffee shop just down the street from Peter's house, and we ended up chatting for about an hour over breakfast.

The bedroom got a bit hot at night...Other than that a good place to rest your head.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 60, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4779), List()), List(sentiment, 63, 104, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4741), List()), List(sentiment, 106, 206, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5451), List()), List(sentiment, 209, 326, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5733), List()), List(sentiment, 328, 407, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5463), List()), List(sentiment, 409, 443, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5313), List()), List(sentiment, 444, 444, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 445, 445, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5140), List()), List(sentiment, 446, 492, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5064), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>We spent a couple of days in Sylvia's wonderful little apartment.

Because of its age it is a little rustic when it comes to water temp in the shower, but it is cozy and cheerful. Anyone who likes historical homes (as I do) won't mind what is old but will find it charming.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean, we had everything we needed, plenty of space for the two of us, plus lots of privacy and quiet. Sylvia made sure we had enough fans in the room in addition to the air conditioner, which was really great for us because we are not acclimated to the hot, humid Texas summers.\r\n\r\nWe did not use it but the kitchen also had anything we might have needed. \r\n\r\nThe beds are soft which might be a concern for anyone with a bad back, but we slept great and there were plenty of pillows (Yay!).\r\n\r\nThe property is in a good location, not far from downtown, an easy drive from and to the airport, and it is also very close to a great Mexican cafe that stays open late, serves the real deal Mexican food for Great prices, all with really good service! We loved it.\r\n\r\nThanks Sylvia for contributing to our fun weekend in Austin.

It's furniture shows Raquels great taste that is reflected all over the house as well. A nice private bathroom with a huge shower perfects the room.\nThe living room and the kitchen are really beatiful again. On thursdays the room is cleaned up. I honestly couldn't think of anything missing or any suggestions to make it better.\n\nLocation:\nThe location is pretty perfect. You have basically have a busstation in front of the house, that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes (line 6 / 12$ for a ticket that lasts a week). It's also in walking distance of a few nice foodtrucks, 2 bars and a small supermarket. And if you want quiet at night, it gives you that as well. Since it's a little of the main part (highway/downtown), nothing is distrubing you at night. All in all, it really couldn't have been better.\n\nWhat made the whole stay very special:\nThe Host(s):\nWow! If the room, the house and the location where great, Raquel and Ginger where the ones to make my stay into something truely special. From the first moment on, I felt welcome and was really happy to talk to them every time. Throughout my week it felt more and more like staying with friends. Coming home after a long day and having a nice chat about how our day was made the stay soooo special. Saying goodbye at the end of my stay had nothing to do with checking out, it was saying goodbye to friends!\n\nPS: Just to be complete here. It was always made very clear, that if I wanted my privacy, I could just go to my room and not participate in any conversation and neither Raquel nor Ginger would have been disappointed. Taking part in daily life was my decision and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it!

I enjoyed, more than I can express, sitting and talking to Felise during our stay, we had some good laughs and fun conversations. She truly is an amazing lady with a heart of pure gold. The communication was great before, during and after. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful yard with chairs to relax in. Felise showed us around the house and made sure any question we had were answered. Her house was spotless, I wish I could keep my house as clean! The bedroom is roomy with tons of space to put your luggage and other items. The bed was amazingly comfy and the sheets were divine. We had the whole bathroom to ourselves and she provided many extras for us to use which was a nice bonus. Felise offered us space in her fridge for our cold items which was so helpful! Her house is in a perfect location, we were going to the Palmer Event Center and she was just a short drive, close enough to the city where it was easy to access but far enough to escape the madness of it all. There are many places to shop, eat and explore within minutes of her house, the location was great! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, we were never woken through the night with outside noise. Perfect! The chickens and turkeys were so much fun to watch and feed. Felise introduced us to her beloved pets by name and allowed us to feed them. What a blast! It was so much fun sitting in the covered patio after a long day and watching them play and explore in her back yard. While in our bedroom, we never heard the chickens during our stay. Our last morning, Felise made us an amazing breakfast, delicious!!! It was by far the best meal of our weekend. Before we left, we got to pick an adorable wind chime, made special by Felise, to take home with us. She has a wonderful story in the bedroom about these chimes, please read it.

It was Memorial Day, it was my birthday, and another host cancelled on me at 9:30 the day of. I had friends in from Dallas and Houston so I was super stressed. She didn't have time to get it cleaned before and was super transparent about helping me and giving me a discount because of it, so that was super awesome! Without her we wouldn't have had anywhere to go. If I wouldn't have gotten a coupon from Airbnb with this place I honestly don't think it is worth the price of 365 a night. It says it sleeps 6, but there was only one extra blanket. The water pressure in the kitchen was barely functioning, there are minimal dishes to actually cook, it states there is a hot tub, when really it is just a jacuzzi tub. It states there is a grill, but it didn't look like it would even work if we tried. It also states that it is good for kids, but there were many exposed wires and I had to keep an eye on the kids because some areas didn't feel totally safe. The hot water also didn't work which wasn't ideal. The blinds were all cracked and didn't even go down all the way in one of the rooms. Overall I think it is a great place if you are just looking for basic accommodation, but I don't feel that it was truly worth the price. Although I do very much appreciate the host being flexible and accommodating in a time of need I am leaving my honest review. Nonetheless we enjoyed our time there.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 28, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7493), List()), List(sentiment, 30, 122, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5043), List()), List(sentiment, 124, 188, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 190, 344, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5591), List()), List(sentiment, 346, 393, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 395, 517, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5335), List()), List(sentiment, 519, 576, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 578, 745, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 829, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5379), List()), List(sentiment, 831, 986, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 988, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5304), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1122, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5014), List()), List(sentiment, 1124, 1259, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5358), List()), List(sentiment, 1261, 1385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4693), List()), List(sentiment, 1387, 1424, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5324), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>The house was beautiful, Jane did an excellent job of communicating with me prior to the trip.

We did message the owners and they responded right away! My husband talked to the owners and they were so helpful! They walked us through setting up the pool heater and tried to help with the wifi.

For future travelers, i'll say that this is a small spot....maybe 280sq.ft if that. Its the bed, bathroom/shower(good water pressure) and closet.

The only word for these pictures is “lie”.\n\nFacts:\n\nAmenities pale in comparison to exaggerated advertisement.\n\nThe entrance and elevator were trashed and barely functional. Had to take multiple trips to get 4 people and our luggage to the room.  If more people are checking in or out at the same time, it's better to walk the 10 flights.\n\n1. ) The condo was extremely cramped and beaten.  \n\n2.) Beds and pillows were worn.  If you want additional bedding there are literally 4 mattresses that you have to throw on the floor.\n\n3.) The air conditioner was barely functional, even while set at the regulated 67 degrees, causing the place to near outdoor temperatures.  \n\n4.) The pool was literally lime green and locked closed.  Had it not been closed, the pool looked like it was the public pool in “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and wouldn't have been worth a dip.\n\n5.) The loft had 2 broken blinds and other damage from previous tenants and the owner tried charging us for them.\n\n6.) The balcony was nearly nonexistent and overlooked the neighbor’s dumpsters and rooftop.  For reference, people were storing a kayak on its side in one of the units and it barely fit.  \n\n7.) Owner was defensive and “technical” in his description of the heap saying “this is exactly what I advertised”.  Ignore his phony hospitality. \n\nTerry, Terry, good ol’ TERRY. Whatever you do, stay away from this Airbnb. We had a group of 12 young professionals looking forward to the one weekend a year where we do a fantasy football destination draft.  The group had moderate expectations and we were overwhelmingly disappointed.   I was the last to arrive, and before I boarded my flight, my buddies were sending me pictures of this pathetic unit and asking for a refund for the over sized dorm room. The owner, Terry, was as responsive as he was defensive and provided no help except for “access” to the pool next door (another overwhelming pile that wasn't worth the walk).  We regret paying even a quarter of the price for this falsely advertised dorm room sauna.  \n\nAs dramatic as the review seems, its factual and represents the feelings of all 12 members of the group.

Its a strait shot to downtown so that you don't even need to get on a freeway. Location on the East side gives you some breathing room from the sometimes oppressive college atmosphere of downtown's UT contingency. \n\nThe indispensable AC system for the room was unbelievable. Usually AC at overnight places is not enough or way too much, but Peter has installed a killer Mitsubishi cooler that you can adjust for quick results and without drying out your sinuses. Plenty of plugs and great wireless for business-ing.\n\nPeter made a point of meeting me personally, which not all hosts bother to do.

The parking situation is addressed in reviews already and by the host - it's very steep, nothing else to it. We had 2x cars parked in drive way that stayed there the whole time. Everyone else, coming and going, stayed at the bottom level. I'd recommend this. Please heed these warnings and words of advice especially at night.

When I did check-in, I knocked and messaged my host that I arrived. Yet, I waited over 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I did NOT receive any prior instructions before. I was lucky enough to check an area that had the key to get in. His excuse, he forgot. As soon as I entered the door, I get this foul odor and don't know where it is coming from. I then check the beds and they look unmade, which don't know even if they are clean or not (I asked about it, which my host said that they were). I go into the restroom it is untidy overall along with crap stains in toilet. I go into the kitchen to try to figure out where that smell is coming from. The kitchen is also unkempt, which food stains and food pieces all over the oven and microwave counter. So I call my host to tell him about the smell. He apologized and claimed the guy who manages he place would come after work (did not give me an exact time) to clean up. And he himself could not come since he was out of town. So he told me to go ahead and throw away food in the frig if I wanted to or take out the trash already there. So I did throw some items out and took out the trash in common area and in one of the bedrooms...But if your guest feels more like the cleaning lady than your guest, then you are WRONG. I could not stand the smell so I had to leave and buy SOMETHING to get that odor out, which I had to bomb the place with eliminating-odor products to get the smell at tolerable levels. I spent at least $20 on cleaning supplies (was not compensated for it even after my stay). My host's management (one guy that does the 'tidy' up) never came to check up on me that night or the next day day to follow-up. Although my host did inform me since I did not have my light on, his management assumed I was sleeping that night. Yet I would have appreciated the next day follow-up. Again, that did NOT happen. I will say this host was nice, amiable, communicative (not at first), and respectful when I talked to him over the phone. He felted bad about my experience and was constantly apologizing for it. He gave me a 1/3 reduced price off after (still not enough) & even offered the next night free (which I had already booked another reservation already). I just wished he would have taken more initiative to correct my issues immediately or prior to my arrival. So the take away from my bad experience? If you want a taste of that college experience, this is it!

Bus line is steps away.  Uber/Lyft rides are $7-$9 to/from there and about $20 to/from the airport.  Uber is easier to get than Lyft during peak times.  Every driver and friend who came by commented how cool the house looks.  Neighborhood appears to be at the start of a revitalization where one or two homes on the block are renovated and the others not, but it feels safe.  I walked it every morning to exercise and explore.  There's also a big park about two blocks south, right along the river.\r\n\r\nSpace looks just like the photos.  Clean and bright.  Private.  Surprisingly comfortable bed... just be nimble enough to navigate up and down the ladder.\r\n\r\nWish there were a closet and/or drawers.

I'd contacted them about a week in advance to discuss procedures and at that time disclosed my arrival plans around 1 p.m.  Check in/out was listed as \"flexible,\" and they said that was fine, but when I touched down at the airport, I got a text apologizing, saying check-in isn't normally until 4 and could I come at 3 because the other tenant hadn't checked out yet.  I wasn't planning on wandering Austin with a suitcase for two hours, and I really just needed to drop my things off (and charge my phone) before going downtown.  I arrived just before the previous tenants and they were apologetic, saying they left to go for coffee and decided to do some sight-seeing before checking out and the time got away from them.  I think it was more awkward for them than for me.  It would've been a big deal if I were exhausted and needed a shower or to sleep, but I literally dropped off my bag, charged my phone and went straight back out until later that evening.  \r\n\r\nI had a great stay.

He showed us the room and when I asked to see the kitchen and dining he said there are dogs on the other side so I held back and didn't ask any question. After he left I texted him to ask if there an iron, my wife need to press the clothes for next day for an event. He said the iron is in the garage and he would have to look around and will give it to me in the morning, and then I asked if I can use the kitchen to put milk and he never replied back. In the morning I called him and he said the kitchen is not for us to use, when I booked the room it showed that there is a kitchen, dining area and a backyard, later the pictures have been taken down and now I can see only the picture of the room, so no fridge for me to use to store milk for my kids. Then on top he said that i need to pay extra for my two kids, I asked him three day before that we will be bringing our two kids which was not originally planned and asked if it would be an issue. He didn't reply until the day of our travel and asked me to pay extra for the kids, the way he put it was if I pay him he will take $60 but if I use Airbnb they will charge me $120. I called airbnb and they said there is no additional charges for my kids, it was't in the contract when I book the trip, so he change the terms later knowing that he capitalize the situation. I never got the Iron and he even said he will give us the cooler for the milk and wrote about it on Airbrb to make it seem that he is being a good host by meeting our request. \r\n\r\nAnother thing my wife noticed that there sheets and cups were dirty. Well why bother putting cups there when you can't wash them. There were no trash can outside for us to at least throw the trash outside. \r\n\r\nI didn't complain and kept it quite, I didn't want to ruin my trip by arguing and getting into small things but the last word is mine.

The bed is comfortable and the room is fully stocked with a personal A/C unit, a Keurig machine, water, snacks, TV, and WiFi. We had a private bathroom stocked with toiletries (Khiel's face wash!), a hair dryer, curling iron... I think there might have even been some sort of aroma therapy. Besides the living/bathing quarters, Peter's house offers a full kitchen, living room, laundry room, backyard, parking spot AND a tiny house. Definitely request a tour of the Tiny House from Peter. It's pretty incredible – he also AirBnB's it out! Besides the physical accommodations, Peter's lovely dogs, Muddy and Penny were so fun to get to know.

It's furniture shows Raquels great taste that is reflected all over the house as well. A nice private bathroom with a huge shower perfects the room.\nThe living room and the kitchen are really beatiful again. On thursdays the room is cleaned up. I honestly couldn't think of anything missing or any suggestions to make it better.\n\nLocation:\nThe location is pretty perfect. You have basically have a busstation in front of the house, that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes (line 6 / 12$ for a ticket that lasts a week). It's also in walking distance of a few nice foodtrucks, 2 bars and a small supermarket. And if you want quiet at night, it gives you that as well. Since it's a little of the main part (highway/downtown), nothing is distrubing you at night. All in all, it really couldn't have been better.\n\nWhat made the whole stay very special:\nThe Host(s):\nWow! If the room, the house and the location where great, Raquel and Ginger where the ones to make my stay into something truely special. From the first moment on, I felt welcome and was really happy to talk to them every time. Throughout my week it felt more and more like staying with friends. Coming home after a long day and having a nice chat about how our day was made the stay soooo special. Saying goodbye at the end of my stay had nothing to do with checking out, it was saying goodbye to friends!\n\nPS: Just to be complete here. It was always made very clear, that if I wanted my privacy, I could just go to my room and not participate in any conversation and neither Raquel nor Ginger would have been disappointed. Taking part in daily life was my decision and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it!

With that said, Felise has been my favorite host out of every one of them. She loves what she does and she loves making her guests have the best experience possible. You can feel the care and thought put into everything in her house, down to the toilet paper being folded like they do at the fancy hotels. I enjoyed, more than I can express, sitting and talking to Felise during our stay, we had some good laughs and fun conversations. She truly is an amazing lady with a heart of pure gold. The communication was great before, during and after. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful yard with chairs to relax in. Felise showed us around the house and made sure any question we had were answered. Her house was spotless, I wish I could keep my house as clean! The bedroom is roomy with tons of space to put your luggage and other items. The bed was amazingly comfy and the sheets were divine. We had the whole bathroom to ourselves and she provided many extras for us to use which was a nice bonus. Felise offered us space in her fridge for our cold items which was so helpful! Her house is in a perfect location, we were going to the Palmer Event Center and she was just a short drive, close enough to the city where it was easy to access but far enough to escape the madness of it all. There are many places to shop, eat and explore within minutes of her house, the location was great! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, we were never woken through the night with outside noise. Perfect! The chickens and turkeys were so much fun to watch and feed. Felise introduced us to her beloved pets by name and allowed us to feed them. What a blast! It was so much fun sitting in the covered patio after a long day and watching them play and explore in her back yard. While in our bedroom, we never heard the chickens during our stay. Our last morning, Felise made us an amazing breakfast, delicious!!! It was by far the best meal of our weekend. Before we left, we got to pick an adorable wind chime, made special by Felise, to take home with us. She has a wonderful story in the bedroom about these chimes, please read it. There is so much love and care put into these wind chimes that I felt privileged to be able to take one home with me. She carefully packaged it up for us so we could transport it home safely. Our stay was perfect, I can not think of one thing that could be improved. Felise is an excellent host with excellent accommodations.

All the amenities were wonderful and she stocked plenty of drinks, yogurt and bananas for us. I got to use her foam roller too.

It was Memorial Day, it was my birthday, and another host cancelled on me at 9:30 the day of. I had friends in from Dallas and Houston so I was super stressed. She didn't have time to get it cleaned before and was super transparent about helping me and giving me a discount because of it, so that was super awesome! Without her we wouldn't have had anywhere to go. If I wouldn't have gotten a coupon from Airbnb with this place I honestly don't think it is worth the price of 365 a night. It says it sleeps 6, but there was only one extra blanket. The water pressure in the kitchen was barely functioning, there are minimal dishes to actually cook, it states there is a hot tub, when really it is just a jacuzzi tub. It states there is a grill, but it didn't look like it would even work if we tried. It also states that it is good for kids, but there were many exposed wires and I had to keep an eye on the kids because some areas didn't feel totally safe. The hot water also didn't work which wasn't ideal. The blinds were all cracked and didn't even go down all the way in one of the rooms. Overall I think it is a great place if you are just looking for basic accommodation, but I don't feel that it was truly worth the price. Although I do very much appreciate the host being flexible and accommodating in a time of need I am leaving my honest review. Nonetheless we enjoyed our time there.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 28, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7493), List()), List(sentiment, 30, 122, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5043), List()), List(sentiment, 124, 188, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 190, 344, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5591), List()), List(sentiment, 346, 393, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 395, 517, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5335), List()), List(sentiment, 519, 576, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 578, 745, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 829, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5379), List()), List(sentiment, 831, 986, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 988, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5304), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1122, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5014), List()), List(sentiment, 1124, 1259, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5358), List()), List(sentiment, 1261, 1385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4693), List()), List(sentiment, 1387, 1424, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5324), List()))</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>The house was beautiful, Jane did an excellent job of communicating with me prior to the trip.

The only word for these pictures is “lie”.\n\nFacts:\n\nAmenities pale in comparison to exaggerated advertisement.\n\nThe entrance and elevator were trashed and barely functional. Had to take multiple trips to get 4 people and our luggage to the room.  If more people are checking in or out at the same time, it's better to walk the 10 flights.\n\n1. ) The condo was extremely cramped and beaten.  \n\n2.) Beds and pillows were worn.  If you want additional bedding there are literally 4 mattresses that you have to throw on the floor.\n\n3.) The air conditioner was barely functional, even while set at the regulated 67 degrees, causing the place to near outdoor temperatures.  \n\n4.) The pool was literally lime green and locked closed.  Had it not been closed, the pool looked like it was the public pool in “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and wouldn't have been worth a dip.\n\n5.) The loft had 2 broken blinds and other damage from previous tenants and the owner tried charging us for them.\n\n6.) The balcony was nearly nonexistent and overlooked the neighbor’s dumpsters and rooftop.  For reference, people were storing a kayak on its side in one of the units and it barely fit.  \n\n7.) Owner was defensive and “technical” in his description of the heap saying “this is exactly what I advertised”.  Ignore his phony hospitality. \n\nTerry, Terry, good ol’ TERRY. Whatever you do, stay away from this Airbnb. We had a group of 12 young professionals looking forward to the one weekend a year where we do a fantasy football destination draft.  The group had moderate expectations and we were overwhelmingly disappointed.   I was the last to arrive, and before I boarded my flight, my buddies were sending me pictures of this pathetic unit and asking for a refund for the over sized dorm room. The owner, Terry, was as responsive as he was defensive and provided no help except for “access” to the pool next door (another overwhelming pile that wasn't worth the walk).  We regret paying even a quarter of the price for this falsely advertised dorm room sauna.  \n\nAs dramatic as the review seems, its factual and represents the feelings of all 12 members of the group.  Would love to post actual pictures if allowed to. \n\nBest,\n\nSmuth</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 44, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5072), List()), List(sentiment, 47, 88, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4579), List()), List(sentiment, 91, 156, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5151), List()), List(sentiment, 159, 219, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5254), List()), List(sentiment, 221, 291, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5269), List()), List(sentiment, 294, 384, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5070), List()), List(sentiment, 387, 434, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5444), List()), List(sentiment, 439, 469, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4920), List()), List(sentiment, 472, 571, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5306), List()), List(sentiment, 574, 711, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5301), List()), List(sentiment, 716, 771, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5442), List()), List(sentiment, 774, 915, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5416), List()), List(sentiment, 918, 1030, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4825), List()), List(sentiment, 1033, 1123, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4561), List()), List(sentiment, 1126, 1218, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4996), List()), List(sentiment, 1223, 1336, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4468), List()), List(sentiment, 1339, 1367, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5255), List()), List(sentiment, 1371, 1399, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4461), List()), List(sentiment, 1401, 1444, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5613), List()), List(sentiment, 1446, 1577, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5338), List()), List(sentiment, 1580, 1655, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5292), List()), List(sentiment, 1659, 1827, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5354), List()), List(sentiment, 1829, 2002, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4893), List()), List(sentiment, 2005, 2093, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4667), List()), List(sentiment, 2098, 2201, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5055), List()), List(sentiment, 2204, 2252, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5788), List()), List(sentiment, 2256, 2267, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6753), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>The home was beautiful - nestled in a really fun part of Austin between South Congress and South Lamar (both of which you could spend a weekend exploring).

He stressed that for any question I had during my stay, I could just call or text him and he would be more than happy to help.  The listing was extremely accurate and, though the exact location is not given, his mention of the house's proximity to a well known coffee shop (which he listed by name-Figure 8) was very useful in getting an idea of where the place was located.  The photos are slightly dated but everything not pictured has been listed in the photo descriptions and if anything, the suite is nicer now than in the pictures.  There have been additions since the pictures were taken of: an AT&T U-Verse equipped TV facing the bed, a chair along the same wall as the one the restroom door is on, a table next to the entry door with a Keurig coffee maker & snacks, additional wall artwork and a lamp on the bedside table on the wall between the bed and the restroom.  The bathroom is stocked with high-end products and the water pressure/quantity in the shower is truly unbelievable.  The neighborhood is good.  The East side of Austin is \"coming up\", so to speak, and has progressed substantially in that regard.  There are plenty of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. within easy walking distance.  My Uber ride to meet friends at the Westin downtown (at 5th & San Jacinto) cost me $7.41 in peak traffic and we had to re-route due to street closures for an event which was not bad at all.

When I did check-in, I knocked and messaged my host that I arrived. Yet, I waited over 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I did NOT receive any prior instructions before. I was lucky enough to check an area that had the key to get in. His excuse, he forgot. As soon as I entered the door, I get this foul odor and don't know where it is coming from. I then check the beds and they look unmade, which don't know even if they are clean or not (I asked about it, which my host said that they were). I go into the restroom it is untidy overall along with crap stains in toilet. I go into the kitchen to try to figure out where that smell is coming from. The kitchen is also unkempt, which food stains and food pieces all over the oven and microwave counter. So I call my host to tell him about the smell. He apologized and claimed the guy who manages he place would come after work (did not give me an exact time) to clean up. And he himself could not come since he was out of town. So he told me to go ahead and throw away food in the frig if I wanted to or take out the trash already there. So I did throw some items out and took out the trash in common area and in one of the bedrooms...But if your guest feels more like the cleaning lady than your guest, then you are WRONG. I could not stand the smell so I had to leave and buy SOMETHING to get that odor out, which I had to bomb the place with eliminating-odor products to get the smell at tolerable levels. I spent at least $20 on cleaning supplies (was not compensated for it even after my stay). My host's management (one guy that does the 'tidy' up) never came to check up on me that night or the next day day to follow-up. Although my host did inform me since I did not have my light on, his management assumed I was sleeping that night. Yet I would have appreciated the next day follow-up. Again, that did NOT happen. I will say this host was nice, amiable, communicative (not at first), and respectful when I talked to him over the phone. He felted bad about my experience and was constantly apologizing for it. He gave me a 1/3 reduced price off after (still not enough) & even offered the next night free (which I had already booked another reservation already). I just wished he would have taken more initiative to correct my issues immediately or prior to my arrival. So the take away from my bad experience? If you want a taste of that college experience, this is it!

It's really close to several major freeways to get you anywhere in the Austin area. The kitchen has everything you need to cook and enjoy eating in.

The shower head is great, and it is really convenient having a washer and dryer available right in the condo. There was lots of available parking in front of the building. Check in and check out was easy, and the host was great at keeping in touch. If you're coming in at night, you might ask for some directions to help you find the right condo since there are four separate staircases for the building and you can only access the condo from two of them.

I wasn't planning on wandering Austin with a suitcase for two hours, and I really just needed to drop my things off (and charge my phone) before going downtown.  I arrived just before the previous tenants and they were apologetic, saying they left to go for coffee and decided to do some sight-seeing before checking out and the time got away from them.  I think it was more awkward for them than for me.  It would've been a big deal if I were exhausted and needed a shower or to sleep, but I literally dropped off my bag, charged my phone and went straight back out until later that evening.  \r\n\r\nI had a great stay.

He showed us the room and when I asked to see the kitchen and dining he said there are dogs on the other side so I held back and didn't ask any question. After he left I texted him to ask if there an iron, my wife need to press the clothes for next day for an event. He said the iron is in the garage and he would have to look around and will give it to me in the morning, and then I asked if I can use the kitchen to put milk and he never replied back. In the morning I called him and he said the kitchen is not for us to use, when I booked the room it showed that there is a kitchen, dining area and a backyard, later the pictures have been taken down and now I can see only the picture of the room, so no fridge for me to use to store milk for my kids. Then on top he said that i need to pay extra for my two kids, I asked him three day before that we will be bringing our two kids which was not originally planned and asked if it would be an issue. He didn't reply until the day of our travel and asked me to pay extra for the kids, the way he put it was if I pay him he will take $60 but if I use Airbnb they will charge me $120. I called airbnb and they said there is no additional charges for my kids, it was't in the contract when I book the trip, so he change the terms later knowing that he capitalize the situation. I never got the Iron and he even said he will give us the cooler for the milk and wrote about it on Airbrb to make it seem that he is being a good host by meeting our request. \r\n\r\nAnother thing my wife noticed that there sheets and cups were dirty. Well why bother putting cups there when you can't wash them. There were no trash can outside for us to at least throw the trash outside. \r\n\r\nI didn't complain and kept it quite, I didn't want to ruin my trip by arguing and getting into small things but the last word is mine. I had a very bad experience and I would not recommend anyone to stay there. He was a weird guy and I didn't get a good vibe from him. Another thing to note, the operating license was expired last year in August and was under some Lady name.

I travel to Austin for work, and decided to stay for the weekend with my boyfriend. We truly felt like we were getting the local experience – as if Peter's home were our own. The bed is comfortable and the room is fully stocked with a personal A/C unit, a Keurig machine, water, snacks, TV, and WiFi. We had a private bathroom stocked with toiletries (Khiel's face wash!), a hair dryer, curling iron... I think there might have even been some sort of aroma therapy. Besides the living/bathing quarters, Peter's house offers a full kitchen, living room, laundry room, backyard, parking spot AND a tiny house. Definitely request a tour of the Tiny House from Peter. It's pretty incredible – he also AirBnB's it out! Besides the physical accommodations, Peter's lovely dogs, Muddy and Penny were so fun to get to know. They were so sweet!\r\n\r\nIn terms of getting to know Austin as a local, Peter spent a lot of time getting to know us, answering questions, and providing suggestions of where to go in Austin. One morning, we ran into Peter at Figure 8, a great coffee shop just down the street from Peter's house, and we ended up chatting for about an hour over breakfast. It was awesome.\r\n\r\nThank you, Peter for helping to make our AirBnB stay so awesome!\r\n</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 2, 4, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6666), List()), List(sentiment, 5, 23, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5282), List()), List(sentiment, 25, 46, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5125), List()), List(sentiment, 48, 84, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5399), List()), List(sentiment, 91, 178, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5354), List()), List(sentiment, 180, 262, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4926), List()), List(sentiment, 264, 353, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5880), List()), List(sentiment, 355, 479, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5105), List()), List(sentiment, 481, 581, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6001), List()), List(sentiment, 583, 644, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5016), List()), List(sentiment, 646, 786, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4938), List()), List(sentiment, 788, 842, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4777), List()), List(sentiment, 844, 892, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5404), List()), List(sentiment, 894, 994, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5008), List()), List(sentiment, 996, 1014, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7178), List()), List(sentiment, 1019, 1183, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4804), List()), List(sentiment, 1185, 1347, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5275), List()), List(sentiment, 1349, 1363, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6133), List()), List(sentiment, 1368, 1431, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6413), List()))</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>Peter was a fantastic host!!

It's furniture shows Raquels great taste that is reflected all over the house as well. A nice private bathroom with a huge shower perfects the room.\nThe living room and the kitchen are really beatiful again. On thursdays the room is cleaned up. I honestly couldn't think of anything missing or any suggestions to make it better.\n\nLocation:\nThe location is pretty perfect. You have basically have a busstation in front of the house, that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes (line 6 / 12$ for a ticket that lasts a week). It's also in walking distance of a few nice foodtrucks, 2 bars and a small supermarket. And if you want quiet at night, it gives you that as well. Since it's a little of the main part (highway/downtown), nothing is distrubing you at night. All in all, it really couldn't have been better.\n\nWhat made the whole stay very special:\nThe Host(s):\nWow! If the room, the house and the location where great, Raquel and Ginger where the ones to make my stay into something truely special. From the first moment on, I felt welcome and was really happy to talk to them every time. Throughout my week it felt more and more like staying with friends. Coming home after a long day and having a nice chat about how our day was made the stay soooo special. Saying goodbye at the end of my stay had nothing to do with checking out, it was saying goodbye to friends!\n\nPS: Just to be complete here. It was always made very clear, that if I wanted my privacy, I could just go to my room and not participate in any conversation and neither Raquel nor Ginger would have been disappointed. Taking part in daily life was my decision and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it!

I enjoyed, more than I can express, sitting and talking to Felise during our stay, we had some good laughs and fun conversations. She truly is an amazing lady with a heart of pure gold. The communication was great before, during and after. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful yard with chairs to relax in. Felise showed us around the house and made sure any question we had were answered. Her house was spotless, I wish I could keep my house as clean! The bedroom is roomy with tons of space to put your luggage and other items. The bed was amazingly comfy and the sheets were divine. We had the whole bathroom to ourselves and she provided many extras for us to use which was a nice bonus. Felise offered us space in her fridge for our cold items which was so helpful! Her house is in a perfect location, we were going to the Palmer Event Center and she was just a short drive, close enough to the city where it was easy to access but far enough to escape the madness of it all. There are many places to shop, eat and explore within minutes of her house, the location was great! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, we were never woken through the night with outside noise. Perfect! The chickens and turkeys were so much fun to watch and feed. Felise introduced us to her beloved pets by name and allowed us to feed them. What a blast! It was so much fun sitting in the covered patio after a long day and watching them play and explore in her back yard. While in our bedroom, we never heard the chickens during our stay. Our last morning, Felise made us an amazing breakfast, delicious!!! It was by far the best meal of our weekend. Before we left, we got to pick an adorable wind chime, made special by Felise, to take home with us. She has a wonderful story in the bedroom about these chimes, please read it. There is so much love and care put into these wind chimes that I felt privileged to be able to take one home with me. She carefully packaged it up for us so we could transport it home safely.

It was Memorial Day, it was my birthday, and another host cancelled on me at 9:30 the day of. I had friends in from Dallas and Houston so I was super stressed. She didn't have time to get it cleaned before and was super transparent about helping me and giving me a discount because of it, so that was super awesome! Without her we wouldn't have had anywhere to go. If I wouldn't have gotten a coupon from Airbnb with this place I honestly don't think it is worth the price of 365 a night. It says it sleeps 6, but there was only one extra blanket. The water pressure in the kitchen was barely functioning, there are minimal dishes to actually cook, it states there is a hot tub, when really it is just a jacuzzi tub. It states there is a grill, but it didn't look like it would even work if we tried. It also states that it is good for kids, but there were many exposed wires and I had to keep an eye on the kids because some areas didn't feel totally safe. The hot water also didn't work which wasn't ideal. The blinds were all cracked and didn't even go down all the way in one of the rooms. Overall I think it is a great place if you are just looking for basic accommodation, but I don't feel that it was truly worth the price. Although I do very much appreciate the host being flexible and accommodating in a time of need I am leaving my honest review. Nonetheless we enjoyed our time there.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 28, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7493), List()), List(sentiment, 30, 122, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5043), List()), List(sentiment, 124, 188, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 190, 344, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5591), List()), List(sentiment, 346, 393, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 395, 517, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5335), List()), List(sentiment, 519, 576, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 578, 745, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 829, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5379), List()), List(sentiment, 831, 986, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 988, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5304), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1122, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5014), List()), List(sentiment, 1124, 1259, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5358), List()), List(sentiment, 1261, 1385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4693), List()), List(sentiment, 1387, 1424, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5324), List()))</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>The house was beautiful, Jane did an excellent job of communicating with me prior to the trip.

If more people are checking in or out at the same time, it's better to walk the 10 flights.\n\n1. ) The condo was extremely cramped and beaten.  \n\n2.) Beds and pillows were worn.  If you want additional bedding there are literally 4 mattresses that you have to throw on the floor.\n\n3.) The air conditioner was barely functional, even while set at the regulated 67 degrees, causing the place to near outdoor temperatures.  \n\n4.) The pool was literally lime green and locked closed.  Had it not been closed, the pool looked like it was the public pool in “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and wouldn't have been worth a dip.\n\n5.) The loft had 2 broken blinds and other damage from previous tenants and the owner tried charging us for them.\n\n6.) The balcony was nearly nonexistent and overlooked the neighbor’s dumpsters and rooftop.  For reference, people were storing a kayak on its side in one of the units and it barely fit.  \n\n7.) Owner was defensive and “technical” in his description of the heap saying “this is exactly what I advertised”.  Ignore his phony hospitality. \n\nTerry, Terry, good ol’ TERRY. Whatever you do, stay away from this Airbnb. We had a group of 12 young professionals looking forward to the one weekend a year where we do a fantasy football destination draft.  The group had moderate expectations and we were overwhelmingly disappointed.   I was the last to arrive, and before I boarded my flight, my buddies were sending me pictures of this pathetic unit and asking for a refund for the over sized dorm room. The owner, Terry, was as responsive as he was defensive and provided no help except for “access” to the pool next door (another overwhelming pile that wasn't worth the walk).  We regret paying even a quarter of the price for this falsely advertised dorm room sauna.  \n\nAs dramatic as the review seems, its factual and represents the feelings of all 12 members of the group.

Usually AC at overnight places is not enough or way too much, but Peter has installed a killer Mitsubishi cooler that you can adjust for quick results and without drying out your sinuses. Plenty of plugs and great wireless for business-ing.\n\nPeter made a point of meeting me personally, which not all hosts bother to do.

It was very close to downtown and a great deal!

We felt so welcomed even though we arrived late in the evening & she took the time to explain all the details of her home. Felise is a very accommodating and gracious host.  A lovely breakfast with coffee was prepared both mornings we were there.  Watching  the chickens at play was very entertaining.  Our room was very clean and quiet and the bed, comfortable. We never saw her indoor pets during our stay. The location was very convenient to us as it was right off the HWY.  It was hard to pick a wind chime, that she made, as they were all so pretty. So we let her select one for us. When we left we thanked her for the stay and we felt as we just visited a friend. We would enjoy staying with her again when we visit Austin.  </td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 53, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4899), List()), List(sentiment, 56, 177, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4633), List()), List(sentiment, 179, 227, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4887), List()), List(sentiment, 230, 301, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5111), List()), List(sentiment, 304, 356, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4444), List()), List(sentiment, 359, 417, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4944), List()), List(sentiment, 419, 463, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4977), List()), List(sentiment, 465, 531, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5591), List()), List(sentiment, 534, 609, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 611, 642, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4889), List()), List(sentiment, 644, 724, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4791), List()), List(sentiment, 726, 784, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5245), List()))</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>Sylvia is very hospitable and that's why the rating has stars.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood didn't feel walkable on Sunday: many places were closed when I went out, including the BBQ place mentioned in the guide.
