It's furniture shows Raquels great taste that is reflected all over the house as well. A nice private bathroom with a huge shower perfects the room.\nThe living room and the kitchen are really beatiful again. On thursdays the room is cleaned up. I honestly couldn't think of anything missing or any suggestions to make it better.\n\nLocation:\nThe location is pretty perfect. You have basically have a busstation in front of the house, that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes (line 6 / 12$ for a ticket that lasts a week). It's also in walking distance of a few nice foodtrucks, 2 bars and a small supermarket. And if you want quiet at night, it gives you that as well. Since it's a little of the main part (highway/downtown), nothing is distrubing you at night. All in all, it really couldn't have been better.\n\nWhat made the whole stay very special:\nThe Host(s):\nWow! If the room, the house and the location where great, Raquel and Ginger where the ones to make my stay into something truely special. From the first moment on, I felt welcome and was really happy to talk to them every time. Throughout my week it felt more and more like staying with friends. Coming home after a long day and having a nice chat about how our day was made the stay soooo special. Saying goodbye at the end of my stay had nothing to do with checking out, it was saying goodbye to friends!\n\nPS: Just to be complete here. It was always made very clear, that if I wanted my privacy, I could just go to my room and not participate in any conversation and neither Raquel nor Ginger would have been disappointed. Taking part in daily life was my decision and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it!

Her home is lovely and is in a great neighborhood, we went jogging around both mornings and had a great time.   Whenever I am back in Austin I would love to stay with Felise and recommend that you do too! </td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 26, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6360), List()), List(sentiment, 29, 204, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4616), List()), List(sentiment, 207, 314, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4959), List()), List(sentiment, 317, 425, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5299), List()), List(sentiment, 429, 520, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6142), List()))</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td><td>negative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>17616608</td><td>161826721</td><td>2017-06-18</td><td>129572342</td><td>Nora</td><td>This was my first Air BnB stay. If all go as smoothly and the hosts are all as nice and with the beautiful Energy Felise''s puts out, I know I will use it as much as possible when traveling. Felise's home is so inviting and beautiful. She greeted us with a beautiful and welcoming smile and made us feel like family.  The chickens and turkeys were such a delight to watch and be around. They had me smiling and wanting to just be around them. She went above and beyond to make our stay was great. She provides any toiletries you may need and the bed and towels were nice and soft. She left a couple of lights on for us, because we were going to be getting in pretty late from a family function. We really appreciated that and tried to be as quiet as church mice when we got back. Thank you from the bottom of my Heart Felise. My daughter and I had a GREAT stay and LOVE LOVE LOVE your home. I will definitely be staying there again, if there is availability, when I am in that area. I think as word spreads as to the gem that is your place, people will want to be staying and enjoying your hospitality and all you have to offer.

With that said, Felise has been my favorite host out of every one of them. She loves what she does and she loves making her guests have the best experience possible. You can feel the care and thought put into everything in her house, down to the toilet paper being folded like they do at the fancy hotels. I enjoyed, more than I can express, sitting and talking to Felise during our stay, we had some good laughs and fun conversations. She truly is an amazing lady with a heart of pure gold. The communication was great before, during and after. When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful yard with chairs to relax in. Felise showed us around the house and made sure any question we had were answered. Her house was spotless, I wish I could keep my house as clean! The bedroom is roomy with tons of space to put your luggage and other items. The bed was amazingly comfy and the sheets were divine. We had the whole bathroom to ourselves and she provided many extras for us to use which was a nice bonus. Felise offered us space in her fridge for our cold items which was so helpful! Her house is in a perfect location, we were going to the Palmer Event Center and she was just a short drive, close enough to the city where it was easy to access but far enough to escape the madness of it all. There are many places to shop, eat and explore within minutes of her house, the location was great! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, we were never woken through the night with outside noise. Perfect! The chickens and turkeys were so much fun to watch and feed. Felise introduced us to her beloved pets by name and allowed us to feed them. What a blast! It was so much fun sitting in the covered patio after a long day and watching them play and explore in her back yard. While in our bedroom, we never heard the chickens during our stay. Our last morning, Felise made us an amazing breakfast, delicious!!! It was by far the best meal of our weekend. Before we left, we got to pick an adorable wind chime, made special by Felise, to take home with us. She has a wonderful story in the bedroom about these chimes, please read it. There is so much love and care put into these wind chimes that I felt privileged to be able to take one home with me. She carefully packaged it up for us so we could transport it home safely.

It was Memorial Day, it was my birthday, and another host cancelled on me at 9:30 the day of. I had friends in from Dallas and Houston so I was super stressed. She didn't have time to get it cleaned before and was super transparent about helping me and giving me a discount because of it, so that was super awesome! Without her we wouldn't have had anywhere to go. If I wouldn't have gotten a coupon from Airbnb with this place I honestly don't think it is worth the price of 365 a night. It says it sleeps 6, but there was only one extra blanket. The water pressure in the kitchen was barely functioning, there are minimal dishes to actually cook, it states there is a hot tub, when really it is just a jacuzzi tub. It states there is a grill, but it didn't look like it would even work if we tried. It also states that it is good for kids, but there were many exposed wires and I had to keep an eye on the kids because some areas didn't feel totally safe. The hot water also didn't work which wasn't ideal. The blinds were all cracked and didn't even go down all the way in one of the rooms. Overall I think it is a great place if you are just looking for basic accommodation, but I don't feel that it was truly worth the price. Although I do very much appreciate the host being flexible and accommodating in a time of need I am leaving my honest review. Nonetheless we enjoyed our time there.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 28, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.7493), List()), List(sentiment, 30, 122, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5043), List()), List(sentiment, 124, 188, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5512), List()), List(sentiment, 190, 344, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5591), List()), List(sentiment, 346, 393, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4806), List()), List(sentiment, 395, 517, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5335), List()), List(sentiment, 519, 576, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5571), List()), List(sentiment, 578, 745, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4967), List()), List(sentiment, 747, 829, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5379), List()), List(sentiment, 831, 986, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5407), List()), List(sentiment, 988, 1037, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5304), List()), List(sentiment, 1039, 1122, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5014), List()), List(sentiment, 1124, 1259, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5358), List()), List(sentiment, 1261, 1385, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4693), List()), List(sentiment, 1387, 1424, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5324), List()))</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td><td>negative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>21361062</td><td>463127189</td><td>2019-06-02</td><td>223032931</td><td>Mark</td><td>The house was beautiful, Jane did an excellent job of communicating with me prior to the trip.

The only word for these pictures is “lie”.\n\nFacts:\n\nAmenities pale in comparison to exaggerated advertisement.\n\nThe entrance and elevator were trashed and barely functional. Had to take multiple trips to get 4 people and our luggage to the room.  If more people are checking in or out at the same time, it's better to walk the 10 flights.\n\n1. ) The condo was extremely cramped and beaten.  \n\n2.) Beds and pillows were worn.  If you want additional bedding there are literally 4 mattresses that you have to throw on the floor.\n\n3.) The air conditioner was barely functional, even while set at the regulated 67 degrees, causing the place to near outdoor temperatures.  \n\n4.) The pool was literally lime green and locked closed.  Had it not been closed, the pool looked like it was the public pool in “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and wouldn't have been worth a dip.\n\n5.) The loft had 2 broken blinds and other damage from previous tenants and the owner tried charging us for them.\n\n6.) The balcony was nearly nonexistent and overlooked the neighbor’s dumpsters and rooftop.  For reference, people were storing a kayak on its side in one of the units and it barely fit.  \n\n7.) Owner was defensive and “technical” in his description of the heap saying “this is exactly what I advertised”.  Ignore his phony hospitality. \n\nTerry, Terry, good ol’ TERRY. Whatever you do, stay away from this Airbnb. We had a group of 12 young professionals looking forward to the one weekend a year where we do a fantasy football destination draft.  The group had moderate expectations and we were overwhelmingly disappointed.   I was the last to arrive, and before I boarded my flight, my buddies were sending me pictures of this pathetic unit and asking for a refund for the over sized dorm room. The owner, Terry, was as responsive as he was defensive and provided no help except for “access” to the pool next door (another overwhelming pile that wasn't worth the walk).  We regret paying even a quarter of the price for this falsely advertised dorm room sauna.  \n\nAs dramatic as the review seems, its factual and represents the feelings of all 12 members of the group.  Would love to post actual pictures if allowed to. \n\nBest,\n\nSmuth</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 44, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5072), List()), List(sentiment, 47, 88, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4579), List()), List(sentiment, 91, 156, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5151), List()), List(sentiment, 159, 219, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5254), List()), List(sentiment, 221, 291, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5269), List()), List(sentiment, 294, 384, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5070), List()), List(sentiment, 387, 434, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5444), List()), List(sentiment, 439, 469, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4920), List()), List(sentiment, 472, 571, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5306), List()), List(sentiment, 574, 711, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5301), List()), List(sentiment, 716, 771, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5442), List()), List(sentiment, 774, 915, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5416), List()), List(sentiment, 918, 1030, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4825), List()), List(sentiment, 1033, 1123, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4561), List()), List(sentiment, 1126, 1218, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4996), List()), List(sentiment, 1223, 1336, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4468), List()), List(sentiment, 1339, 1367, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5255), List()), List(sentiment, 1371, 1399, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4461), List()), List(sentiment, 1401, 1444, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5613), List()), List(sentiment, 1446, 1577, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5338), List()), List(sentiment, 1580, 1655, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5292), List()), List(sentiment, 1659, 1827, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5354), List()), List(sentiment, 1829, 2002, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4893), List()), List(sentiment, 2005, 2093, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4667), List()), List(sentiment, 2098, 2201, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5055), List()), List(sentiment, 2204, 2252, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5788), List()), List(sentiment, 2256, 2267, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.6753), List()))</td><td>positive</td><td>negative</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>46924798</td><td>2015-09-14</td><td>1654417</td><td>Bryan</td><td>The home was beautiful - nestled in a really fun part of Austin between South Congress and South Lamar (both of which you could spend a weekend exploring).

You can easily walk to several restaurants, an Irish bar, and a grocery store. If you're needing to get around the neighborhood quickly, but don't want to drive, there's hundreds of lime or bird scooters scattered around. We used them everyday! Free parking was one of my biggest reasons for ditching something outside of downtown. I also thought it was fairly fast (15 minutes, non-highway) to get to downtown which makes the location ideal to get out of the craziness, but keep you close to the action you wanted to see. I loved that the owner's had some extra household amenities especially since it didn't make sense for us to go shopping for items we only needed for 2 days. Unit was nice, clean, and comfy.

Usually AC at overnight places is not enough or way too much, but Peter has installed a killer Mitsubishi cooler that you can adjust for quick results and without drying out your sinuses.

Also, you might want to bring a sleeping mask if you are sensitive to light -- I sleep like a rock but my friend had a hard time with all the ambient light from the windows + light curtains. \r\n\r\nAll in all, a good first experience using AirBnb :) </td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 59, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5190), List()), List(sentiment, 61, 95, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4701), List()), List(sentiment, 97, 128, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4857), List()), List(sentiment, 130, 188, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5268), List()), List(sentiment, 190, 286, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4706), List()), List(sentiment, 288, 399, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5042), List()), List(sentiment, 405, 509, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5058), List()), List(sentiment, 510, 622, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5103), List()), List(sentiment, 624, 813, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5214), List()), List(sentiment, 819, 869, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4269), List()))</td><td>negative</td><td>negative</td><td>negative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>5456</td><td>1986631</td><td>2012-08-14</td><td>3091823</td><td>José</td><td>Sylvia was a great host.

The only bummer was that the drainage seemed pretty backed up; the water would fill up about two inches, and take a little while to drain out. Alex was apologetic about this, but his maintenance person wasn't able to fix it during our stay. The other minor issues I noticed were that there wasn't much toilet paper stocked in the house for as many folks as we had staying, but he did have his cleaning person come replenish. So that was very nice! The towels weren't readily available, but after a little searching we found them upstairs in the hall closet. Even though Alex wasn't in town during our stay, he was easily reached and super communicative. I definitely appreciated that! One other thing I would note is that the notes on the house say there is a hot tub, but we never located one. I had told all the girls to bring suits, so we were really looking forward to that, but it wasn't a huge deal at the end of the day!

They appreciated the keyless entry system and noted how simple the process was to get in and out.  The added security made them feel safe as they had two small children in the house. The living rook area was cozy and the ability to play Sony PS3 was an added bonus for their teenager.  The neighborhood was perfectly convenient to downtown yet felt secluded and private.  The bedrooms were nicely anointed and fit the needs of their family.  I myself did not stay in the residence but I too was impressed with the accommodations. Even when there was a small keyless entry issue during my preparations before the family arrived, Alex was right on point and made the necessary adjustments in a timely manner.  Overall,  a very pleasurable experience for my entire family and I would definitely recommend this property to anyone, especially those with a family or several little ones running around.</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 190, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4633), List()), List(sentiment, 193, 272, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4570), List()), List(sentiment, 275, 367, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5263), List()), List(sentiment, 370, 466, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5395), List()), List(sentiment, 469, 551, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5553), List()), List(sentiment, 553, 653, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5514), List()), List(sentiment, 656, 739, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5432), List()), List(sentiment, 742, 809, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4829), List()), List(sentiment, 812, 898, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5436), List()), List(sentiment, 900, 1075, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4948), List()), List(sentiment, 1078, 1265, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5180), List()))</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td><td>negative</td><td>negative</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>86211036</td><td>2016-07-15</td><td>74670910</td><td>Andrea</td><td>We really enjoyed the week at Alex and Marwa's home.

Here is a summary of our experience.\n\nPositives\n•\tSuperfast Wi-Fi with (Hidden by Airbnb) Fiber, especially in the family room. Speeds can reach (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) megabits/second. (The US average is around 11.5 megabits/second.)\n•\tWide variety of TV programming available.  Acceptable quality of home entertainment system.\n•\tNice, newer appliances in kitchen & laundry with a variety of useful small appliances.\n•\tRelatively convenient location although lots of twists & turns to reach property ( (Hidden by Airbnb) maps & turn by turn directions are a requirement.\n•\tOff-street parking (although not covered and on a steep driveway).\n\n\nNegatives\n\n•\tFinishing touches to property are missing. Some examples:\no\tNo window coverings in the master bathroom\no\tNo window coverings in the family room & adjacent dining area.\no\tPlumbing in master bathroom shower is unfinished with extra corroded pipe below the showerhead\no\tBackyard & patio was unfinished/uninviting with leaves, weeds & trash.\n•\tNumerous light bulbs were burned out or missing (no spares were found.)  Not enough reading lights in bedrooms or living room.\n•\tHome entertainment system had no instructions on how to set up and operate. When we arrived, only the left speaker of the sound system was operational. Remote Control for the TV was missing; was later located living with the “dust bunnies” on the floor behind the entertainment center.\n•\tAlso, no instructions were provided about how to operate the appliances or handle the trash (e.g. date of pickup, recycle?, etc.)\n•\tCleanliness of dishes was poor. Several dishes, silverware items and pots & pans had been put away dirty & were food encrusted. \n•\tAlso, the (relatively new) dishwasher seemed to have a problem with getting dishes clean. (Perhaps the wastewater filter system is clogged?)\n•\tWall had white unpainted areas where sheetrock repair compound had been applied and never finished. One window had a large paintbrush smear that had not been removed.\n•\tThe downstairs bedroom does not have a real wall; it is separated from the entry hall by a thin folding door that is unframed and does not reach to the ceiling. This bedroom has access to a ½, not full, bath.\n\nBased on our other AirBnB stays, we found this property to be a disappointment.  However, Alex seemed to be responsive and attuned to renters’ comments.  Therefore, we hope that many of these “cons” will be corrected for future guests. \n\t\n</td><td>List(List(sentiment, 0, 172, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5195), List()), List(sentiment, 176, 211, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5210), List()), List(sentiment, 214, 302, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5175), List()), List(sentiment, 304, 368, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4917), List()), List(sentiment, 370, 416, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5554), List()), List(sentiment, 417, 461, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4838), List()), List(sentiment, 464, 511, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5173), List()), List(sentiment, 513, 600, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5648), List()), List(sentiment, 602, 754, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4943), List()), List(sentiment, 756, 823, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5055), List()), List(sentiment, 827, 881, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4919), List()), List(sentiment, 883, 1006, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4871), List()), List(sentiment, 1008, 1176, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5243), List()), List(sentiment, 1178, 1305, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5035), List()), List(sentiment, 1307, 1383, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4845), List()), List(sentiment, 1385, 1459, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4942), List()), List(sentiment, 1461, 1498, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.6658), List()), List(sentiment, 1500, 1593, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5500), List()), List(sentiment, 1595, 1724, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5382), List()), List(sentiment, 1725, 1759, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5291), List()), List(sentiment, 1761, 1855, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4500), List()), List(sentiment, 1858, 1948, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5189), List()), List(sentiment, 1950, 2101, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.5508), List()), List(sentiment, 2103, 2168, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5079), List()), List(sentiment, 2170, 2220, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.4538), List()), List(sentiment, 2222, 2331, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5064), List()), List(sentiment, 2333, 2379, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5220), List()), List(sentiment, 2382, 2460, positive, Map(confidence -> 0.4681), List()), List(sentiment, 2463, 2533, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5510), List()), List(sentiment, 2536, 2616, negative, Map(confidence -> 0.5423), List()))</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td><td>positive</td></tr><tr><td>7351170</td><td>132895389</td><td>2017-02-19</td><td>2039955</td><td>Katie</td><td>The place was super tidy and spacious!

While the infamous Franklin’s BBQ is in the neighborhood, I would recommend Black’s BBQ, a short bus ride away. You won’t be disappointed. I’m sure everyone has their favorite BBQ.

So you should be comfortable with whomever you are traveling with.

They left step by step check-in and check out instructions and provided just about anything you could think you might need on a trip away from home including extra phone chargers, card games, and coffee k-cups.
